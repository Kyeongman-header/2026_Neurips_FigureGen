  "caption": "Figure 2: CRITIQ Flow comprises two major components: multi-criteria pairwise judgment and the criteria evolution process. The multi-criteria pairwise judgment process employs a series of worker agents to make quality comparisons under a certain criterion. The criteria evolution process aims to obtain data quality criteria that highly align with human judgment through an iterative evolution. The initial criteria are retrieved from the knowledge base. After evolution, we select the final criteria to annotate the dataset for training CRITIQ Scorer.",
