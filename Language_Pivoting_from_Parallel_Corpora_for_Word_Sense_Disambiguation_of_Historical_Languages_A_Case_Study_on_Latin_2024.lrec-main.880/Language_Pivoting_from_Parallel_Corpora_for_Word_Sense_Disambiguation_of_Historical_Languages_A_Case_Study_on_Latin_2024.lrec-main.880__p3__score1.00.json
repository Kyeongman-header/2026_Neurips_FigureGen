  "caption": "Figure 1: An example of the two annotation propagation methods described. Two parallel Latin-English sentences are used so that the English sentence is disambiguated by a state-of-the-art WSD system, which obtains the WordNet synset identifiers for each lemma in the English sentence. At this point the synset for the target Latin word (i.e. sanctam) is chosen in one of the two methods: a) Propagationw/inter: we take the union of the English synsets w and the possible synsets for sanctam v. b) Propagationw/align: we use a word alignment module to obtain the English word associated with the target word sanctam (i.e. holy) and we assign the English synset w6 as the synset of the target word.",
