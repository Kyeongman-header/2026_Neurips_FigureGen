Upon receiving a user task, the agent iterates through a three-step ReAct process (Yao et al., 2023): (1) Thought generation, analyzing the current situation and planning subsequent steps; (2) Action determination, selecting the appropriate tool and its input based on the generated thought; and (3) Observation obtaining, executing a tool in the environment and obtaining the results or feedback. This iterative cycle continues until task completion or conclusion, and the final answer is returned to the user.",
