  "caption": "Figure 2: GEMINI uses a controller to decide ext/abs styles, and further switch the decoder accordingly between a rewriter and a generator. We express the identifier tokens “<S>” and “<Sk>” in the concise form “S” and “Sk”, and we use “w1 w2” to represent the tokens in the first sentence and “w3 w4” the tokens in the second sentence. Group tags are converted into embeddings and added to the input token embeddings for both the encoder and decoder. The decoder predicts an identifier token to determine the group tag of the following timesteps, for example “<S2>” to start the group tag “2” until the end of the sentence “</S>”.",
