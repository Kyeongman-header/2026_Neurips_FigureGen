  "caption": "Figure 2: MISGENDERED Framework: We create a dataset to evaluate the ability of large language models to correctly ‘gender’ individuals. We manually write templates, each referring to an individual and containing a blank space for a pronoun to be filled-in. We populate the templates with names (unisex, female, and male) and pronouns (binary, gender-neutral, and non-binary), and declare two to five pronoun forms are for each individual either explicitly or parenthetically. We then use masked and auto-regressive LMs to predict missing pronouns in each instance utilizing a unified constrained decoding method.",
