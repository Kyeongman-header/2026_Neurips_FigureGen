  "caption": "Figure 1: Overview of our experiment with prompts asking for different length constraints for the desired translation, complemented with few-shot examples demonstrating the given constraint (match) or not (no-match). Strong enough control to reach isometric translation needs matching instructions and preferably Tiny or Short demonstrations. The construction of demonstration sets is described in Section 3 and the prompt content is presented in Table 6 in Appendix B.2.",
