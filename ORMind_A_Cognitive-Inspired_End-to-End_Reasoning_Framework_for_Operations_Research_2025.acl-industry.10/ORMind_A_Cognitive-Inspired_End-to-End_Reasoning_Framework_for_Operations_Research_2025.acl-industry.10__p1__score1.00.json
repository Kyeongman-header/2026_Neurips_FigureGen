  "caption": "Figure 1: Current frameworks rely on complex agent orchestration with unpredictable execution paths, dramatically increasing API calls and computation time. Their focus on code syntax rather than mathematical accuracy results in costly errors that can propagate through business operations undetected. This excessive coordination overhead makes these systems impractical for time-sensitive business applications. Compared to traditional methods, ORMind employs a streamlined end-to-end workflow with counterfactual reasoning, significantly enhancing solution reliability.",
