Given language and task adapters (left), language arithmetic (right) enables post-processing, training-free improvement in two use-cases: (i) zero-shot where a language adapter for a target language was not trained (presented in the figure as Spanish, which was not part of existing language adapters pool, LAes(en, fr)) or (ii) to improve existing language adapters via arithmetic with either related language or a language on which task adapter was trained (e.g. LAfr(en, fr)).",
