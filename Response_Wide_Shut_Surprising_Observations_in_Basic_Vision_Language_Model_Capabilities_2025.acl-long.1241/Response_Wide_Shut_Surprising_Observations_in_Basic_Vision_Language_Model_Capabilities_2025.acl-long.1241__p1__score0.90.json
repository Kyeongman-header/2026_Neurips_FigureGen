  "caption": "Figure 2: Qualitative results supporting the findings of our analysis. We show prediction (correct vs incorrect) for three spaces i.e visual, VL projection and response. We notice correct predictions in intermediate spaces and incorrect predictions in response space for object recognition and counting task. Furthermore, we notice a reversal in trend for spatial understanding task, where the response space has more correct predictions compared to intermediate spaces.",
