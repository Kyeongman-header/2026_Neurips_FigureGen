  "caption": "Figure 2: An overview of the TaxoCritic method. fa, fc1 and fc2 represent the feature representations (vectors) of the inputs for the actor and two critics respectively. The actor (a two-layer fully connected feed-forward neural network) takes the encoding of a state as the input and outputs the policy π. Following this policy, the environment executes a sampled action which contains two sub-actions. As shown on the right side, the critic network features two sub-critics and a mixing layer. Considering the state and two sub-actions, one critic evaluates the child’s choice, while the other evaluates the parent’s choice. The mixing layer combines those results from both critics and produces the action value q.",
