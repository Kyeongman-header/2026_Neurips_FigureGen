Additionally, we also generate resasoning using ZS-CoDR with only Tect modality. ZS-CoDR’s(multimodal) response is better aligned with the ground truth as it mentions the patient’s remark on the arrangement of letters and links it with cognitive distortion.ZS-CoDR’s( only Text) response falls short in comparison to the multimodal in terms of coherence with ground truth and clarity.While ZeroNLG’s response is more generic and not very informative.",
