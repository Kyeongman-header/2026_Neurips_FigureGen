  "caption": "Figure 1: The framework of our ESpeW. The upper part presents an overview of watermark injection and model extraction. (1) The stealer queries the provider’s EaaS to obtain a dataset that maps texts to embeddings. During this process, the provider injects watermarks. (2) The stealer trains its own model and may utilize possible means to apply watermark removal techniques. (3) The provider queries the stealer’s EaaS for copyright verification. The lower part offers a detailed explanation of the key modules for watermark insertion and verification.",
