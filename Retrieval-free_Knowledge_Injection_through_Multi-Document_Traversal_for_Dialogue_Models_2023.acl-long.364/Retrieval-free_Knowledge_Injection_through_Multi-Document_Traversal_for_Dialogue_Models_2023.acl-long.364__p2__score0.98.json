To construct in-depth and topic-diversified dialogues, KiDG (1) builds an AG for each document to distinguish aspects; (2) connects topic-related documents to construct ATG; (3) utilizes the traversal algorithm MDT to walk through ATG to sample a sequence of knowledge sentences and transform them to a simulated dialogue. Note that, the Representative Nodes are marked in the darkest color, black, purple and red arrows represent the topic relations derived from Web Hyperlink, Knowledge Graph and Word vector respectively.",
