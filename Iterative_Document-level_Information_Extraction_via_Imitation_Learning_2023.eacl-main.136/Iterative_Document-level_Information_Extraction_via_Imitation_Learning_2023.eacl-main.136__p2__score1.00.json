  "caption": "Figure 3: The basic iteration step of ITERX (left box), and an unrolled version on SCIREX 4-ary relation extraction (extraction of templates in the form {Task, Method, Dataset, Metric}) executed on the NLP paper Bidirectional Attention Flow for Machine Comprehension (Seo et al., 2017). Span embeddings (X(0) ) are passed as input to the first step, where the model extracts the template {Task: Machine comprehension, Question answering; Method: BiDAF; Dataset: SQuAD; Metric: Exact match}. This information is propagated via our memory mechanism to the second step, and informs prediction of the next template: {Task: Machine comprehension; Method: BiDAF; Dataset: CNN/DailyMail; Metric: Accuracy}. The third step assigns the null slot type Y to all spans, indicating that the model is unable to find any further templates, thus stopping the generation process.",
