We use GPT-4o to generate bridginginference RC items for given reading passages via few-shot prompting, comparing conditions with and without chain-of-thought prompts. We prompt each inference type separately: pronominal bridging, text-connecting, and gap-filling inferences. Human evaluation focuses on general item quality, inference type appropriateness, and LLM rationales.",
