The sentences are divided among 5 interpreters, and 3 sets of splits: zeroshot (“zs”), signer-independent finetuning (“si”), and signer-dependent finetuning (“sd”). We blur the interpreters’ faces in this paper for privacy, but the underlying dataset is unblurred because facial expressions are an essential component of the grammar of sign languages.",
