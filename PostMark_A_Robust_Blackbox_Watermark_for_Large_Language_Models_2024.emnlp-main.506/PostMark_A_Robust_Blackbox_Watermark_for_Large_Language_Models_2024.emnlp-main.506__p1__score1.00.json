  "caption": "Figure 1: The POSTMARK watermarking and detection procedure. Given some unwatermarked input text, we generate its embedding using the EMBEDDER and compute its cosine similarity with all word embeddings in the SECTABLE, performing top-k selection and additional semantic similarity filtering to choose a list of words. Then, we instruct the INSERTER to watermark the text by rewriting it to incorporate all selected words. During detection, we similarly obtain a watermark word list and check how many of these words are present in the input text.",
