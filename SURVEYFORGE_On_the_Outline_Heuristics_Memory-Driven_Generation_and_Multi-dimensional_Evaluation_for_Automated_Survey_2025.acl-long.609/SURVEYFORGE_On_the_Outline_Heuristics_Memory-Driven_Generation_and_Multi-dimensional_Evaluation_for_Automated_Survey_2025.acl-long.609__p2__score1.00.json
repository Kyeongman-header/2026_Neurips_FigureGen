  "caption": "Figure 2: The overview of SURVEYFORGE. The framework consists of two main stages: Outline Generation and Content Writing. In the Outline Generation stage, SURVEYFORGE utilizes heuristic learning to generate well-structured outlines by leveraging topic-relevant literature and structural patterns from existing surveys. In the Content Writing stage, a memory-driven Scholar Navigation Agent (SANA) retrieves high-quality literature for each subsection and LLM generates the content of each subsection. Finally, the content is synthesized and refined into a coherent and comprehensive survey.",
