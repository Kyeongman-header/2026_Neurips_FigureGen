Given the published version of the article and a question, an expert (in our case, the original paper authors) (1) checks the question and modifies or discards it, (2) annotates whether it is answerable or not (i.e. if there is sufficient information in the paper), and if so (3) highlights the evidence to answer the question and finally (4) provides a free-form answer to the question.",
