  "caption": "Figure 2: There are four steps in CVE-Bench: (1) Environment construction: CVE-Bench uses the three-level information to generate a vulnerability issue as the input to the agent. CVE-Bench clones the CVEs’ corresponding repositories and checks out the repository to the parent commits. (2) Repair patch generation: Next, CVE-Bench sends the queried information divided into multiple levels to the agents for patch generation. (3) Repair validation: At last, CVE-Bench performs execution-based repair patch validation using the unit tests. CVE-Bench also considers comparing the generated patches with the ground truth repair code crafted by the man.",
