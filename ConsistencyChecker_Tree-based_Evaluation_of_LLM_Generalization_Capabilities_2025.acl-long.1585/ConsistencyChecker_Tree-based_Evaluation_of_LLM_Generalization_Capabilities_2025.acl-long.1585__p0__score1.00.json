  "caption": "Figure 1: Overview of the ConsistencyChecker. It shows a self-consistency tree for evaluating LLMs on machine translations. The root node (r) is the initial English sentence generated by the evaluator. Subsequent nodes (vi) are produced by the evaluatee using transformation pairs, such as English→Spanish→English (f1, f ′ 1) and English→German→English (f2, f ′ 2). The evaluation framework supports multilingual translations (e.g., French, Czech, Japanese) and can be extended to programming tasks.",
