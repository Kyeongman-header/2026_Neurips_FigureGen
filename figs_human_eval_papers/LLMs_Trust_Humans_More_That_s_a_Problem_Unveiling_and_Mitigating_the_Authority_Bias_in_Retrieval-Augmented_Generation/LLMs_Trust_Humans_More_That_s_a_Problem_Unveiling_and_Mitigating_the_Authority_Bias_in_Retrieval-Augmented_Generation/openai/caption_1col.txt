Overview of Authority Bias in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG): when user-provided context conflicts with retrieved database knowledge, LLMs disproportionately follow the user, degrading factual accuracy. The figure summarizes ABDD construction, bias metrics (inaccuracy, correctiveness, misleading), and mitigation via CDEQ conflict localization and factuality scoring.
