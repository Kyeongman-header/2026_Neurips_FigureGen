  "caption": "Figure 1: Illustration of Authority Bias in RAG systems. In simple queries, the LLM relies solely on database knowledge for the answer. However, in more complex scenarios with conflicting user-provided and database knowledge, the LLM tends to favor the user’s input, even if incorrect. We characterize this phenomenon of LLMs in RAG as Authority Bias.",
