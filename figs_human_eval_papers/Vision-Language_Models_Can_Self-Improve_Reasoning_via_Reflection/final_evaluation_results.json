              "score": 0.78,
              "reason": "The figure captures the paper’s core pipeline: VQA data → CoT prompting/sampling → partition into positive/negative solutions by answer correctness → multi-task training with three objectives (SFT on positives, self-refine on negatives, self-select among candidates) → iterative improvement, plus a test-time self-select procedure. However, it omits most formal details (e.g., explicit loss formulations, sampling/filtering rules, iteration notation, and how correctness is judged), and it does not reflect other major experimental/analysis components claimed in the paper (e.g., comparisons to STaR/DPO failure analysis, domain coverage details)."

              "score": 0.86,
              "reason": "Largely yes: the left-to-right flow is clear (data → model generates CoTs → label as positive/negative → train with three objectives → improved model), and the test-time compute block shows sampling multiple solutions and selecting the best via a self-select prompt. Color-coding (green/red) and labels help. Some elements remain underspecified for a fully self-contained understanding (e.g., what exactly self-refine/self-select prompts look like, how candidates are constructed, and what the three objectives optimize beyond the high-level arrows)."

              "reason": "The figure summarizes the methodology section well (the central contribution), but it does not cover the full paper arc end-to-end: it excludes experimental setup breadth (multiple benchmarks/domains), baseline comparisons (GPT-distilled, STaR, DPO discussion), quantitative results, ablations/key-factor analyses, and main conclusions. As an overview figure of the method it’s strong; as a complete paper summary it is partial."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "The figure content aligns with the described R3V pipeline: bootstrapping positive/negative CoT solutions, multi-task training with SFT on positives, reflection via self-refine and self-select, and an optional test-time self-selection step. It does not introduce explicit new formulas. Minor potential over-specificity: the left example uses a particular toy VQA scoring table and labels like “Objective I/II/III,” which are not evidenced in the provided text excerpt (though they are plausible shorthand), but they don’t materially add unmentioned methodological components."

              "score": 0.92,
              "reason": "Relationships are depicted consistently with the paper context: (I,x,a) VQA data + CoT prompting → sampled rationales/answers → filtered into positive/negative by answer correctness → training objectives that (i) learn from positives (SFT), (ii) refine negatives into corrected rationales (self-refine), and (iii) select best among candidates (self-select), iterated over rounds; plus test-time compute by sampling multiple solutions then self-selecting. The iterative feedback loop (better model → better samples → better training) is also correctly conveyed. One slight ambiguity is whether the paper explicitly frames the three training parts as separate “Objectives I/II/III” blocks, but the depicted causal flow matches the described framework."

              "score": 0.88,
              "reason": "Key labels match the paper: R3V, bootstrapped CoT samples, positive/negative solutions, reflection on rationale, self-refine, self-select, and test-time compute/self-reflection. The term “Multi-Task Training” is consistent with having multiple losses, though the excerpt specifically names “self-refine and self-select losses” plus learning from positives; the label is reasonable but slightly higher-level than the text. Also, “Self-Select Prompt” at test time is plausible but not explicitly named in the excerpt."

              "score": 0.78,
              "reason": "The figure cleanly foregrounds the core loop (bootstrapped CoT positives/negatives → reflection objectives → iterative training) and separately highlights test-time self-selection, which aligns with the main contribution. However, some micro-level specifics (e.g., example score table, multiple solution boxes with detailed steps, small objective labels) add reading load and slightly dilute the high-level schematic message."

              "score": 0.84,
              "reason": "As an overview diagram, it maps well onto the method section: data source (VQA datasets), sampling to get positive/negative rationales, three training objectives (SFT on positive, self-refine, self-select), and a test-time compute branch. With the caption and surrounding text, the flow is interpretable, though some elements are small and may require zooming to read, slightly reducing immediate clarity."

              "score": 0.7,
              "reason": "Most visual components are functional, but there are mildly redundant or non-essential details for a readability-focused schematic: detailed numeric examples, repeated MLLM boxes, and stylistic icons (e.g., flames/snowflake) that convey intuition but are not strictly necessary. Simplifying the example content and reducing repeated blocks could improve signal-to-noise."

              "score": 0.95,
              "reason": "Overall flow is clearly left-to-right: VQA datasets → bootstrapped CoT samples/training objectives → test-time compute. Arrows and panel ordering reinforce the reading direction, with only minor local loops (training iteration arrows) that do not confuse the main direction."

              "reason": "Most connectors are routed cleanly without crossings. There are a few multi-directional arrows (e.g., between MLLM and objectives, and within the test-time compute block) that come close, but they do not materially overlap or create ambiguous crossings."

              "score": 0.92,
              "reason": "Related elements are well grouped: dataset/question and initial MLLM on the left; positive/negative solutions in the central bootstrapping panel; training objectives are colocated beneath; test-time sampling/selection is isolated in a right panel. Grouping by dashed containers supports proximity well."

              "score": 0.82,
              "reason": "High-level panel layout is aligned, and many elements sit on consistent baselines. However, some internal items (solution cards, small labels, and objective boxes) vary slightly in vertical alignment/centering, making the grid feel less strict at the micro-level."

              "question": "4.5. Hierarchy: Do the important main components stand out in size, thickness, or position?",
              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "Main components (MLLM blocks and the three large panels) are visually dominant via size and containment. Color-coded positives/negatives and objective headers help hierarchy. Minor issue: multiple MLLM blocks (train vs test-time) look similar, which slightly dilutes emphasis on the primary training pipeline."
            },

              "question": "4.6. Margin: Is there sufficient margin between elements?",
              "score": 0.85,
              "reason": "Inter-panel spacing and internal padding are generally adequate, and dashed boxes prevent crowding. Some areas (central solution cards and the bottom objective row) feel moderately dense, with labels and arrows close to shapes, but readability remains acceptable."
            },
            {
              "question": "4.7. Consistency: Are components with similar roles represented with the same shape and color?",
              "score": 0.93,
              "reason": "Consistent visual language: solutions are card-like rectangles; positives/negatives use consistent green/red coding; objectives use similarly styled boxes with numbered headers; MLLM boxes share the same styling. Minor inconsistency: some prompts/auxiliary elements use different border/shape conventions, but overall consistency is strong."

              "score": 0.62,
              "reason": "The figure uses concrete visual shorthand (green/red solution boxes, check/cross marks, dataset table snippet, arrows indicating iteration, and separate dashed regions for training vs. test-time) to embody abstract processes like bootstrapping, positive/negative filtering, and reflection objectives. However, the metaphors remain fairly standard for ML pipelines (color-coded correctness, flow arrows) rather than more conceptually rich symbolic replacements."

              "score": 0.38,
              "reason": "Stylistically it aligns with a common contemporary ML-paper schematic: rounded rectangles, pastel section headers, dashed containers, iconified model blocks, and step-numbered objectives. While clean and cohesive, it does not strongly depart from widely used framework-diagram conventions."

            {
              "question": "5.3. Adaptability: Does it apply a layout more suitable for the specific paper, breaking away from uniform design principles?",
              "score": 0.55,
              "reason": "The layout is tailored to the paper’s contributions by explicitly separating (i) bootstrapped CoT samples, (ii) reflection losses (SFT/self-refine/self-select), and (iii) test-time compute/self-selection, which matches the method narrative. Still, it largely follows a standard left-to-right pipeline with modular boxes, so the adaptation is moderate rather than a major break from uniform design."
