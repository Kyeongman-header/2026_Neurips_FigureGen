  "caption": "Figure 1: This example illustrates the token probabilities of Vicuna-7B model under GCG attack (Zou et al., 2023). The words in red are GCG suffixes. We note that although the token representing the word \"Sure\" has a dominant probability, safety disclaimers such as \"I\", \"Sorry\", and \"As\" are still present in the sample space, which is sorted in descending order in token probabilities. When a safety disclaimer token is sampled, the model would reject the attacker’s harmful query.",
