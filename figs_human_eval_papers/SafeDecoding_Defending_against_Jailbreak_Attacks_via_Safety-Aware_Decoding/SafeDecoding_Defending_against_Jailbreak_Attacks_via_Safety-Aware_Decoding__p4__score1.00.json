  "caption": "Figure 2: This figure illustrates the detail of SafeDecoding. During the training phase, we fine-tune the original LLM to construct an expert model with strengthened safety. In the inference phase, a user query is passed to both the original and expert models. Based on their outputs, SafeDecoding constructs a new token probability distribution. This constructed probability distribution attenuates the probabilities of tokens that are aligned with the attacker’s goal, and amplifies the probabilities of tokens that are aligned with human values. In this example, SafeDecoding is applied only to the first 2 tokens, while the remaining tokens are generated through normal decoding.",
