  "caption": "Figure 4: Efficient IoU-aware weighted cross-entropy computation. (a) M pseudo boxes are generated from the ground-truth box using a GIoU threshold (here, M=3), and concatenated with the original label, enabling a single forward pass for M+1 predictions. (b) The attention map is masked to prevent pseudo boxes from attending to each other. (c) The positional embedding of the ground-truth box is assigned to all pseudo boxes, ensuring a single prediction at inference. Crossentropy is weighted by GIoU relative to ground-truth.",
