  "caption": "Figure 1: We identify a rank bias in GRPO in which model updates only reinforce already probable solutions and fail to surface new ones. This sharpens the distribution and impairs pass@N performance for large N. Our unlikeliness reward addresses rank bias by explicitly encouraging uplifting low-probability correct solutions.",
