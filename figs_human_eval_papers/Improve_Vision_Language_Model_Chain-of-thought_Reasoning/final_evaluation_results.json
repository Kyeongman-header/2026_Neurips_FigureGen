              "reason": "The figure conveys the paper’s core two-stage recipe: (A) diagnosing that direct prediction doesn’t sufficiently teach CoT, and (B) using short answers as outcome rewards to align self-generated rationales (preference-style alignment consistent with DPO). It also illustrates multi-domain distilled CoT examples (world knowledge, charts, document localization, math). However, it omits several major details that are central in the text: the explicit two-stage pipeline framing (GPT-4o CoT augmentation for SFT + DPO alignment) is only partially depicted (GPT-4o distillation is not clearly integrated into the pipeline diagram), dataset scale/coverage (e.g., 193k, 9 datasets) is not represented in the figure itself, and there are no training/objective specifics (DPO pair construction mechanics, reward/verifier role) beyond a high-level sketch. No formulas are shown (likely fine, but it does mean objective-level content is not covered)."

              "reason": "A reader can infer the main operating principle: short-answer-only training may not yield good CoT; instead, generate multiple rationales, judge outcomes via correctness against the short answer, and align the model toward rationales that produce correct answers (preference/feedback loop). The domain panel (Figure 2) further clarifies what “reasoning” looks like across tasks by showing question–rationale–answer triplets. Still, some key links are not fully self-contained: the role of GPT-4o distillation (where the CoT comes from initially) is not explicit in the workflow figure, and the exact learning method (DPO) is mentioned only implicitly/briefly (not enough for a fully clear standalone algorithmic understanding)."

It does not summarize the full paper arc: it lacks experimental setup details, benchmarks and metrics, quantitative results/improvements, ablations, comparisons to baselines, and the verifier/credit-assignment findings mentioned in the text.

However, the figure itself does not explicitly encode the two-stage pipeline (SFT then DPO with outcome rewards); it only shows example rationales, so the relationship to the broader method is implicit rather than explicitly represented."

The dashed arrows and labels (generation/outcome judgment/feedback) make the mechanism reasonably clear.

              "reason": "Relationships are largely faithful: the top panel contrasts training on short answers (direct prediction) with the unobserved underlying reasoning; the bottom panel depicts generating multiple rationales, judging them by whether the final answer matches the short annotation, and aligning preferences toward rationales yielding correct outcomes—consistent with the paper’s outcome-reward DPO framing.

The high-level flow (generation → outcome judgment → feedback/alignment) is easy to follow.

              "reason": "The figure captures a major part of the method/data story: CoT distillation (193k), direct data (193k), formatting data (450), additional CoT (16k G-LLaVA QA/alignment), and a small pretrain-mix (2k), plus how these are combined across several SFT training variants (LLaVA-Next+Format, +Direct, +CoT, Reasoner-SFT). However, it omits other major components central to the paper such as the second-stage alignment/RL via outcome rewards and DPO (and any verifier/reward modeling details), evaluation setup/benchmarks, and key implementation/training specifics (losses, sampling ratios beyond counts, prompting/format details). No formulas are shown."

              "reason": "As a standalone, it conveys the high-level experimental design for SFT: which datasets feed into which model variants and approximate dataset sizes. But it is not fully self-explanatory about the operating principle (e.g., what “CoT distillation” concretely means, how the 450 “CoT sample” vs “Direct sample” are used, what “Format data” changes, what “PT mix” is, and how/why the variants differ in objective). It also does not depict the full two-stage pipeline (SFT then DPO/outcome reward alignment), which limits understanding of the overall system."

It does not summarize the paper end-to-end: motivations/claims, the outcome-reward/DPO stage, verifier use, broader dataset coverage details, experimental results and conclusions are not included.

However, some elements appear under-specified relative to the provided paper context excerpt (e.g., exact items like “450 CoT Sample”, “450 Direct Sample”, “2k data sampled from pre-train distribution”, and “16k G-LLaVA QA and Alignment” are not evidenced in the excerpt shown), so they risk being perceived as introduced without textual support in what’s provided here."

              "reason": "The relationships depicted—separating data sources (CoT distillation vs direct data vs format/extra CoT), and showing different training recipes/mixtures across model variants culminating in a “LLaVA-Reasoner-SFT” that uses both CoT distillation and direct data—align with the paper’s high-level claim of leveraging short-answer data plus distilled CoT for SFT. The figure does not depict the DPO/outcome-reward stage (described elsewhere), but within its stated scope (SFT experiments) the compositional relationships are coherent. Minor ambiguity remains because the figure implies specific comparative training conditions (e.g., “LLaVA-Next+Format”, “LLaVA-Next+Direct”, “LLaVA-Next+CoT”) that are not verifiable from the excerpt alone."

Labels like “Format Data” and “Additional CoT: 16k G-LLaVA QA and Alignment” could be accurate but cannot be confirmed from the provided excerpt, reducing confidence slightly; nonetheless, they do not obviously misname the central methods described."

              "reason": "The figure is generally understandable and logically structured (top: data sources; bottom: model fine-tuning compositions) with consistent color-coding and clear grouping via dashed boxes. However, readability is hindered by small font sizes (especially inside the dashed 'Data Sources' box and the multi-row training recipes), dense text blocks, and low visual hierarchy—key takeaways (e.g., differences among training variants and what the colors map to) require effort to parse. The caption is helpful but the figure would benefit from larger labels, fewer repeated tokens (e.g., '450 Direct Sample' across rows), and stronger emphasis on the primary comparison."

              "reason": "Related items are grouped: data-source components are enclosed together in the top dashed box, and model variants are grouped in the bottom dashed box. However, the legend-like mapping between top 'data sources' blocks and their use in specific model rows requires scanning and is not explicitly co-located per model."

              "reason": "Section headers ('Data Sources', 'Model Fine-tuning') and dashed containers provide a clear high-level hierarchy. Still, key takeaways (e.g., the difference between specific model recipes) do not strongly stand out because most rows share similar visual weight and the dominant numbers/blocks compete for attention."

              "reason": "Overall spacing is adequate, but the top panel is visually busy: many labels and blocks are packed tightly inside the dashed boundary, and the curved arrows come close to labels/blocks. Some text appears close to borders, risking readability at smaller print sizes."

              "reason": "Consistent encoding is used: colored rectangular blocks represent data types across panels, and similar structures repeat across model rows. The same palette appears to map the same concepts (e.g., CoT vs direct vs pretrain mix), aiding comparability."

              "score": 0.42,
              "reason": "The figure uses some concrete visual encodings (color-coded blocks, stacked bars/blocks, brackets/arrows) to stand for abstract notions like data sources and training mixtures, and employs abbreviations (CoT, SFT, PT). However, it largely remains a literal schematic of datasets and sampling rather than using richer metaphoric icons/symbols to convey concepts (e.g., reward/alignment, distillation) beyond labels."

              "reason": "The layout is reasonably adapted to the paper’s needs by explicitly mapping multiple data sources (CoT distillation, direct data, format samples, additional CoT, pretrain mix) to multiple training configurations, enabling quick comparison across model variants. Still, it adheres to conventional block-diagram structure and does not strongly depart from uniform design principles."
