  "caption": "Figure 2: The workflow of PopAlign. PopAlign involves three kinds of contrasting strategies: (1) Prompt Contrast such as Prefix Contrast, Demon Contrast (i.e., Demonstration Contrast, and Elicitive Contrast), (2) Model Contrast such as NParam (number of parameters) Contrast and Leaderboard Contrast, as well as (3) Pipeline Contrast such as Refinement Contrast. By mixing the preference data synthesized with diverse contrasting strategies and conducting DPO alignment training on it, we can easily align the LLM without either human annotation or reward labeling.",
