      "caption": "Figure 2: Comparison of previous adversarial prompts and PAP, ordered by three levels of humanizing. The first level treats LLMs as algorithmic systems: for instance, GCG (Zou et al., 2023) generates prompts with gibberish suffix via gradient synthesis; Deng et al. (2023b) exploits “side-channels” like low-resource languages. The second level progresses to treat LLMs as instruction followers: they usually rely on unconventional instruction patterns to jailbreak (e.g., virtualization or role-play), e.g., Yu et al. (2023) learn the distribution of virtualization-based jailbreak templates to produce jailbreak variants, while PAIR (Chao et al., 2023) asks LLMs to improve instructions as an “assistant” and often leads to prompts that employ virtualization or persona. We introduce the highest level to humanize and persuade LLMs as human-like communicators, and propose PAP. PAP seamlessly weaves persuasive techniques into jailbreak prompt construction, which highlights the risks associated with more complex and nuanced human-like communication to advance AI safety.",

              "reason": "The figure covers several core elements of the paper’s framing: it contrasts prior jailbreak prompt paradigms (optimization/gibberish, side-channel/low-resource language, distribution-based/dual-persona, and instruction-following/role-play) with the proposed Persuasive Adversarial Prompt (PAP), and organizes them along a “humanizing level” axis. However, it omits other major components described in the context, such as the persuasion taxonomy itself (beyond naming emotional appeal), the paraphraser training pipeline, the broad scan over 14 risk categories, iterative probe methodology, quantitative results (e.g., 92%+ ASR) within the figure, and defense/defense-gap findings.

The side-by-side examples and the ordering along humanizing level make the basic principle clear. Still, the mechanism is only implicit (no depiction of the taxonomy-to-generation process, model inputs/outputs, or how prompts are produced automatically), so the operational pipeline is not fully understandable from the figure alone."

These elements are all described in the provided paper excerpt and match the shown examples.

The depiction that PAP ‘weaves persuasive techniques’ into a harmful query paraphrase aligns with the narrative.
