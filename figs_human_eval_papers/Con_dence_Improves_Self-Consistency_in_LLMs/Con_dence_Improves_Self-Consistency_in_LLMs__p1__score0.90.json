  "caption": "Figure 2: A simplified example comparing self-consistency vs CISC. (1) Given an input question, (2) both methods first sample multiple reasoning paths. (4, top) Self-consistency then simply selects the most frequent answer. Conversely, (3) CISC adds a self-assessment step, where a confidence score is assigned to each path (see §4.1 for more advanced methods). Then, (4, bottom) it selects the final answer via a weighted majority vote.",
