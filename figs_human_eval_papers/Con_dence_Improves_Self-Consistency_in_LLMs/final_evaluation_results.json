      "caption": "Figure 2: A simplified example comparing self-consistency vs CISC. (1) Given an input question, (2) both methods first sample multiple reasoning paths. (4, top) Self-consistency then simply selects the most frequent answer. Conversely, (3) CISC adds a self-assessment step, where a confidence score is assigned to each path (see §4.1 for more advanced methods). Then, (4, bottom) it selects the final answer via a weighted majority vote.",

              "score": 0.72,
              "reason": "The figure covers the core pipeline components of both methods (sampling multiple reasoning paths, answer aggregation; plus confidence extraction for CISC and confidence-weighted voting). However, it omits key formal details emphasized in the paper’s definition, notably the softmax normalization and temperature parameter T that governs the frequency–confidence tradeoff, as well as any explicit mathematical formulation of the aggregation."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "Yes. The 4-step layout (Question → sampled Answers → per-sample Confidences → Aggregation) clearly contrasts self-consistency (unweighted majority count) with CISC (confidence-weighted vote). The numeric example makes the mechanism and why the selected answer can differ very clear, even without the paper."

              "reason": "No. The figure is an illustrative schematic of the method only; it does not summarize the paper’s full scope (datasets/models, empirical results/cost reductions, different confidence-estimation methods, the within-question confidence evaluation/WQD metric, calibration discussion, or qualitative human-agreement analysis)."

              "score": 0.95,
              "reason": "The figure only includes elements described in the paper’s explanation of CISC vs. self-consistency: sampling multiple reasoning paths, extracting self-reported confidence (1–10), and aggregating via (unweighted) counts vs confidence-weighted aggregation. It does not introduce unrelated modules or formulas. Minor simplification: it sums raw confidences per answer (e.g., Conf(C)=5+4) rather than showing the paper’s softmax normalization/temperature explicitly, but this is consistent with the caption’s claim of a simplified example."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "The pipeline relations are correctly depicted: Question → multiple sampled answers → confidence extraction per sample → aggregation. Self-consistency selecting the most frequent answer is correctly shown (Count-based majority vote). CISC’s weighted majority vote is qualitatively correct (higher-confidence answer can win despite fewer votes). The only fidelity gap is that the paper defines normalization via softmax with temperature T before aggregation, whereas the figure illustrates weighting by raw confidence sums; as a pedagogical simplification it preserves the intended relationship but omits a key defined step."

              "reason": "Key labels match the paper: 'Self-Consistency', 'CISC', and the staged components '(1) Question', '(2) Answers', '(3) Confidences', '(4) Aggregation'. The confidence is clearly presented as a self-assessed rating, consistent with the paper’s confidence extraction concept. No major methodology is mislabeled."

              "score": 0.82,
              "reason": "The figure is generally easy to parse due to its left-to-right pipeline layout with clear section headers ((1)–(4)) and strong visual grouping. Color cues help distinguish Self-Consistency (red) from CISC (green). However, readability is reduced by (a) small, dense text inside the boxes (especially the multi-line reasoning/answer snippets), (b) multiple font styles and emphasis treatments (italics, bold, colored words) that create visual clutter, and (c) the handwritten-style labels on the right, which are less legible than the rest. Increasing font size, shortening the example text, and using a consistent typeface for method labels would improve overall readability."

              "reason": "Primary stages are emphasized by numbered headings and large bounding boxes; the final decision is highlighted with colored callouts (Self-Consistency vs CISC). Some internal text is dense, slightly diluting the hierarchy within panels (especially in Answers)."

              "reason": "Inter-panel spacing is adequate, but within the Answers and Confidences columns the boxes and text feel tight; the aggregation callouts are also close to the right edge, reducing breathing room."

              "reason": "Repeated elements (answer boxes; confidence boxes) use consistent rounded-rectangle shapes. Color encoding is mostly consistent (e.g., red/green emphasis and red vs green framing for the two methods), though the mixed use of red/green for different semantic roles (options vs correctness vs method comparison) could be slightly confusing."

              "score": 0.32,
              "reason": "The figure uses mild visual metaphors (boxed pipeline stages, arrows, color-coding, and bracketed callouts) to concretize the process, but it largely remains a literal workflow depiction with text-heavy panels rather than using stronger symbolic/iconic representations for concepts like “confidence,” “weighting,” or “aggregation.”"

              "reason": "The style is close to a standard method schematic: numbered stages, rounded rectangles, and a comparison between baselines via colored annotations. It is clear and polished, but not visually distinctive beyond conventional red/green emphasis and callout boxes."

              "reason": "The layout is well-adapted to the paper’s contribution by explicitly aligning each step (question → sampled answers → confidence elicitation → aggregation) and juxtaposing self-consistency vs CISC in the final stage. While still template-like, the targeted side-by-side aggregation comparison and staged numbering reflect task-specific communication rather than a generic block diagram."
