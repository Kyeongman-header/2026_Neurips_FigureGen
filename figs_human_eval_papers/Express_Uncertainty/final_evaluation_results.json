              "score": 0.35,
              "reason": "The figure captures one major component of the paper: the human-study manipulation/conditions (plain statement vs strengthener vs weakener) and the downstream behavioral outcome (rely on LM vs rely on self). However, it omits other major components central to the paper’s contributions, such as the analysis of LMs’ reluctance to express uncertainty, prompting methods for eliciting epistemic markers, calibration/overconfidence findings (e.g., error rates among confident responses), and the RLHF/human-preference-bias investigation. No formulas/metrics (e.g., calibration measures) are included."

              "score": 0.75,
              "reason": "Yes at a high level: it clearly illustrates the experimental setup—same QA content with different epistemic markers—and the intended measurement of human reliance (LM vs self). The legend-like icons make the mapping from marker type to reliance outcome understandable. However, the exact task procedure (what participants do, whether they answer themselves, what 'double check' means operationally, and what the icons quantitatively represent) is not fully specified in the figure alone."

              "score": 0.2,
              "reason": "No. The figure is a narrow overview of only the human-interpretation experiments and does not summarize the full arc of the paper (LM behavioral analysis across models, elicitation prompts, quantitative miscalibration/overconfidence results, longitudinal harms, and the RLHF preference-data bias investigation or proposed mitigations)."

              "score": 0.95,
              "reason": "The figure depicts elements consistent with the provided paper context and caption: a QA example (Mauritania→Nouakchott), three epistemic marker conditions (plain/strengthener/weakener), and human reliance outcomes. No extra formulas or novel components beyond what’s described are introduced."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "The relationships shown—LM expressions of confidence (plain/strengthener/weakener) influencing human interpretations (rely on LM vs rely on self)—match the stated goal of the experiments in the caption and surrounding text. The figure is a schematic overview, not making quantitative claims that contradict the context. Minor ambiguity: it visually suggests specific reliance patterns per condition without explicit numeric grounding in the figure itself."

              "score": 0.95,
              "reason": "Labels align with the paper’s terminology: 'LM Expressions of Confidence', 'Human Interpretations', and epistemic marker categories 'Strengthener', 'Weakener', and 'Plain Statement'. The example utterances are consistent with the definitions (certainty vs uncertainty vs unmarked)."

              "score": 0.78,
              "reason": "The figure cleanly conveys the experimental setup: a question/answer, three epistemic-marker conditions (plain/strengthener/weakener), and the measured human reliance outcome. This is a good schematic of the main contribution (how epistemic markers affect reliance). However, some elements (e.g., repeated icons across rows, the 'Ø' marker explanation) slightly dilute the schematic clarity and could be simplified into a more compact legend or aggregate indicator."

              "score": 0.84,
              "reason": "It aligns well with the caption and surrounding narrative: it illustrates what epistemic markers look like in LM outputs and what participant judgments are being elicited (rely on LM vs rely on self). The left-to-right mapping from LM expression to human interpretation supports quick comprehension. Minor readability issues (small icons and reliance on color coding) could reduce accessibility in print or for color-impaired readers."

              "score": 0.7,
              "reason": "Most content is relevant, but the repeated person icons are somewhat decorative/redundant because they do not encode precise quantitative information (counts/percentages) and take visual space. The same point could be conveyed with a compact bar, proportion, or single aggregated graphic plus a clear legend, improving readability without losing meaning."

              "score": 0.9,

              "score": 1.0,
              "reason": "There are no connecting lines or arrows that could cross; the mapping is implied by column structure and row alignment."

              "question": "4.3. Proximity: Are functionally closely related modules physically placed near each other?",
              "score": 0.85,
              "reason": "Related elements are grouped well: the three confidence expressions are stacked together, and their corresponding “rely” icons are positioned directly to the right on the same rows. The top question/answer is close enough to contextualize the table."
            },
            {
              "question": "4.4. Alignment: Are nodes aligned neatly horizontally and vertically according to an invisible grid?",
              "score": 0.8,
              "reason": "Row structure is mostly grid-aligned (labels, text blocks, and icon groups line up). Minor misalignment comes from varying text lengths and the icon clusters not being perfectly uniform in spacing/edges."

              "score": 0.8,
              "reason": "Primary headers (“LM Expressions of Confidence”, “Human Interpretations”) and the top question/answer provide clear structure. Highlight colors for Strengthener/Weakener add emphasis, though the overall hierarchy could be stronger (e.g., more prominent separation between header and body or clearer emphasis on the experimental mapping)."

            {
              "question": "4.6. Margin: Is there sufficient margin between elements?",
              "score": 0.7,
              "reason": "Generally readable, but the layout is somewhat tight: the icon clusters are dense, and vertical spacing between rows/headers is limited, making the right column feel crowded."
            },
            {
              "question": "4.7. Consistency: Are components with similar roles represented with the same shape and color?",
              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "The three LM expression rows follow a consistent pattern, with consistent typography and row structure. The blue vs orange icons consistently encode reliance categories, and the colored row backgrounds (grey/orange) are applied systematically, though the “Plain Statement” row lacks a strong color cue compared to the others."

              "question": "5.1. Metaphor: To what extent are abstract concepts replaced with concrete icons, symbols, or abbreviations?",
              "score": 0.62,
              "reason": "The figure maps abstract notions (LM confidence expressions; human reliance) into concrete visual elements: a tabular structure, color-coded categories (plain/strengthener/weakener), and repeated person icons split into two colors to depict reliance distributions. The metaphoric encoding is clear but fairly conventional (icons-as-people, color-as-category) and does not introduce richer symbolic metaphors beyond these."

              "question": "5.2. Novelty: Does the generated image have a unique style that differentiates it from common templates?",
              "score": 0.38,
              "reason": "The design resembles common HCI/NLP overview schematics: a two-column comparison, boxed labels, and icon arrays to indicate user responses. While the combination of epistemic-marker examples with reliance icon arrays is tailored, the visual language (table + color highlights + pictograms) is standard and not especially distinctive stylistically."
            },
            {
              "question": "5.3. Adaptability: Does it apply a layout more suitable for the specific paper, breaking away from uniform design principles?",
              "score": 0.57,
              "reason": "The layout is purpose-fit for the paper’s central construct—linking LM phrasing variants to downstream human reliance—by juxtaposing example utterances with an immediate behavioral interpretation panel. It adapts a simple matrix to the task effectively, but still largely adheres to familiar schematic/table conventions rather than a notably unconventional or highly customized visual form."
