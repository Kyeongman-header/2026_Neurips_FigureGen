              "score": 0.25,
              "reason": "The figure shows a single illustrative input-context example for the multi-document QA setup (documents + question + desired answer) and highlights re-ordering to vary relevant-information position. It does not cover the paper’s other major evaluated setting (synthetic key–value retrieval), key experimental variables (context length scaling, position sweeps), models compared, or the main result patterns/metrics (e.g., U-shaped curve, primacy/recency biases) beyond what is implied. No formulas are included (and the paper is not formula-centric), but major experimental components are omitted."

              "score": 0.6,
              "reason": "From the figure alone, a reader can infer the task format (given multiple documents, answer a question using only provided search results) and the manipulation idea (re-order documents; desired answer unchanged). However, the broader operating principle—evaluating how performance changes as relevant information moves through long contexts—and the connection to long-context robustness is not explicit in the figure itself without relying on caption/context."

              "score": 0.1,
              "reason": "This figure is a narrow example tied to one experimental manipulation in multi-document QA. It does not summarize the paper’s full scope (key–value retrieval task, architecture/finetuning analyses, open-domain QA case study, or overall conclusions/protocol recommendations). It is not intended as an end-to-end summary."

              "score": 1.0,
              "reason": "The figure shows an input-context prompt with multiple documents, a question, an answer field, and a desired answer box—elements consistent with the paper’s described multi-document QA setup and the notion of reordering documents to shift the relevant information’s position. No extra formulas or unrelated components are introduced."

              "score": 1.0,
              "reason": "It correctly represents the key relationship: reordering documents changes the position of relevant information in the prompt while leaving the desired output unchanged, matching the paper’s controlled manipulation of relevant-document position in multi-document QA contexts."

              "score": 0.95,
              "reason": "Labels like “Input Context,” “Document [1]/[2]/[3],” “Question,” “Answer,” and “Desired Answer” align with the paper’s terminology and methodology for multi-document QA prompting. Minor ambiguity: the figure itself does not explicitly label which document is the relevant one (though that may be clear from surrounding figures), but the caption’s described intent is consistent."

              "score": 0.72,
              "reason": "The figure is a schematic of the input formatting and the key experimental manipulation (re-ordering documents to change where relevant information appears), which aligns with the paper’s main contribution about position effects in long contexts. However, it includes concrete example text (document titles, question/answer) that adds realism but also introduces some incidental detail that slightly reduces schematic succinctness."

              "score": 0.86,
              "reason": "Yes. With the caption, it clearly illustrates what “modulating the position of relevant information” means operationally in the multi-document QA setup (same desired output, different document order). It supports the surrounding discussion by making the experimental intervention concrete and easy to map to the described protocol."

              "score": 0.78,
              "reason": "The design is utilitarian (boxes and monospaced text) with no decorative graphics. Some content is arguably more verbose than necessary for conveying the idea (full instruction line, multiple document entries, specific titles), but it remains related to the core concept and not purely decorative."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "The question/answer content is grouped within the \"Input Context\" region, and the \"Desired Answer\" is directly below; related items are placed close with clear separation between sections."

              "question": "4.4. Alignment: Are nodes aligned neatly horizontally and vertically according to an invisible grid?",
              "score": 0.85,
              "reason": "The two main boxes are cleanly rectangular and largely aligned; however, the second box appears slightly offset and the internal text alignment relies on typesetting rather than a strong grid for multiple modules."

              "reason": "Primary components (\"Input Context\" and \"Desired Answer\") are distinguished as separate boxed regions and by position. Hierarchy is present but subtle (similar stroke weights; limited visual emphasis beyond labels)."

              "question": "4.7. Consistency: Are components with similar roles represented with the same shape and color?",
              "score": 0.95,
              "reason": "Both main components are represented as consistent monochrome rectangular boxes with similar styling. Labels and content formatting are consistent within their roles."

              "score": 0.1,
              "reason": "The figure is a literal UI-style prompt-and-answer box illustrating an input context and desired answer. It uses minimal symbolic abstraction (boxed regions and labels) and no concrete icons/metaphorical visuals to represent concepts like relevance, position effects, or retrieval."

              "question": "5.2. Novelty: Does the generated image have a unique style that differentiates it from common templates?",
              "score": 0.25,
              "reason": "The design resembles common paper figures that screenshot or mimic a text prompt (monospace text in bordered boxes). While clean and context-appropriate, it does not introduce a distinctive visual language beyond standard callout boxes and labels."

              "score": 0.35,
              "reason": "The layout is tailored to the task by showing the exact prompt structure (documents, question, answer) and the intended target, which supports the paper’s controlled-ordering manipulation. However, it largely adheres to a generic boxed-text schematic rather than a more specialized or inventive layout to emphasize the positional-modulation concept."
