The framework encompasses (1) the data generation of value-informed actions across diverse cultural and social contexts; (2) two tasks for evaluating LLMs’ stated values (i.e., Task1) and value-informed actions (i.e., Task2); and (3) three measures to evaluate their value-action alignment, including value-action alignment rate, alignment distance, and alignment ranking.",
