      "caption": "Figure 1: Main idea of PARC: we enhance zero-shot learning for low-resource languages (LRLs) by crosslingual retrieval from labeled/unlabeled high-resource languages (HRLs). (a) An LRL input sample is taken as query by the cross-lingual retriever to retrieve the semantically most similar HRL sample from the HRL corpus. The label of the retrieved HRL sample is obtained either from the corpus (labeled setting) or by self-prediction (unlabeled setting). (b) The retrieved HRL sample together with its label and the input sample are reformulated as prompts. The cross-lingual retrievalaugmented prompt is created by concatenation and taken by the MPLM for prediction. Our experiments show that PARC outperforms other zero-shot methods and even finetuning.",

              "score": 0.65,
              "reason": "The figure captures the core PARC pipeline components (cross-lingual retriever, HRL corpus retrieval, labeled vs. unlabeled/self-predicted label, prompt construction via pattern+verbalizer, concatenation, MPLM prediction). However, it omits many major elements that typically matter for reproducing/fully understanding the method as presented in a paper: retrieval model/embedding choices, similarity metric, number of retrieved examples (k), prompt template specifics across tasks, verbalizer mapping details, multilingual tasks/datasets, and experimental variables/ablations discussed in the paper. No formulas are presented."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "Yes. The two-panel structure clearly communicates the operating principle: use an LRL input to retrieve a semantically similar HRL example; obtain/produce a label for the retrieved example; convert both into prompt-formatted text; concatenate into a retrieval-augmented prompt; feed to an MPLM to predict the LRL label. The labeled vs. unlabeled pathway is also understandable from the dashed self-prediction box."

              "score": 0.25,
              "reason": "No. The figure is a conceptual overview of the method only. It does not summarize the paper end-to-end (e.g., experimental setup, tasks, languages, baselines, quantitative results, key findings such as correlations with language similarity/pretraining data, robustness analyses, and conclusions/limitations)."

              "score": 0.95,
              "reason": "The figure depicts only elements described in the provided context/caption: cross-lingual retriever, HRL retrieval, labeled vs. unlabeled (self-prediction) label acquisition, prompt engineering, concatenation into a retrieval-augmented prompt, and MPLM prediction with a mask/verbalizer. No extra formulas or unexplained modules are introduced beyond these described steps."

              "score": 0.93,
              "reason": "The pipeline relationships match the caption/method description: LRL input is used as query → retrieve semantically similar HRL sentence → obtain label either from corpus (labeled) or via MPLM self-prediction (unlabeled) → reformulate both retrieved example+label and LRL input into prompts → concatenate → feed to MPLM for final prediction. This aligns with the stated two-step PARC process; any simplification (e.g., showing single retrieved example) is consistent with a conceptual overview."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "Key components are labeled in line with the paper: 'Cross-lingual Retriever', 'English retrieval', 'Self-prediction', 'MPLM', and 'Retrieval-augmented prompt'. The use of HRL=English and an example label ('pos') is consistent with the caption’s HRL/LRL framing and sentiment example. Minor ambiguity: the term 'Prompt engineering' is used as an intermediate label (not necessarily a formal module name), but it correctly describes the reformulation step."

              "score": 0.82,
              "reason": "The two-panel pipeline (retrieval → prompt construction/concatenation → MPLM prediction) foregrounds the main contribution clearly. However, readability is slightly reduced by dense embedded example text (bilingual sentence strings, labels, and mask/verbalizer tokens) that can feel like implementation detail rather than schematic abstraction."

              "score": 0.86,
              "reason": "As a companion to the caption, it is easy to map visual elements to described steps (cross-lingual retriever, labeled vs. self-predicted label, prompt engineering, concatenation, MPLM output). Readability could improve with larger fonts and clearer visual hierarchy; some arrows/boxes and small text may be hard to parse at typical paper zoom levels."

              "score": 0.78,
              "reason": "Mostly functional with minimal decoration; colors help differentiate stages. Still, the figure repeats similar content across panels and includes multiple textual instances (e.g., both raw sentence, gloss/translation, and prompt versions) that add cognitive load and can be trimmed without harming the central message."

              "reason": "Both panels have a clear left-to-right pipeline structure (retriever → retrieved example/label → prompt engineering/concatenation → MPLM → prediction), with panel labeling (a)/(b) reinforcing a top-to-bottom narrative across panels."

              "score": 0.75,
              "reason": "Most connectors are clean, but the dashed feedback/self-prediction path and dashed bounding box edges create mild visual intersections/overlaps that add slight clutter (though not severe line-crossing)."

              "score": 0.85,
              "reason": "Related elements are grouped well: retrieved English sample and label are adjacent; prompt engineering sits near the text it transforms; MPLM is placed near its inputs/outputs. Panel (a) groups self-prediction inside a dashed region appropriately."

              "score": 0.7,
              "reason": "Key blocks are roughly aligned, but several elements (labels, rounded prompt-engineering nodes, and text boxes) have small misalignments and inconsistent baselines, especially between the two panels."

              "reason": "Primary stages (Cross-lingual Retriever, Concatenating, MPLM, final Prediction) are visually emphasized via larger shapes and color fills, but secondary elements (e.g., prompt engineering) are somewhat understated relative to their conceptual importance."

              "score": 0.65,
              "reason": "Spacing is tight in places: text-heavy boxes, the dashed self-prediction region, and connectors crowd each other, reducing breathing room and making the figure feel dense."

              "question": "4.7. Consistency: Are components with similar roles represented with the same shape and color?",
              "score": 0.8,
              "reason": "Text boxes for inputs/retrievals/prompts are consistently styled, and key process nodes (retriever/MPLM) are distinct and repeated consistently. However, multiple visual encodings (solid vs dashed boxes/lines, varied box colors) can blur role consistency slightly."

              "score": 0.48,
              "reason": "The figure uses concrete process-box elements (retriever, MPLM) and a few simplified symbols (arrows, dashed lines, label tags like 'pos', [MASK]) to represent abstract operations (cross-lingual retrieval, self-prediction). However, it largely stays literal—showing example sentences and pipeline flow—rather than employing richer metaphorical iconography or symbolic abstraction."

              "score": 0.34,
              "reason": "The visual style closely follows a standard NLP method schematic: rectangular modules, arrows, stepwise pipeline split into (a)/(b), and embedded text examples. Color use (orange/green/blue) adds clarity but not a notably distinctive visual language compared with typical ACL system diagrams."

              "score": 0.57,
              "reason": "The two-panel layout is tailored to the method’s narrative (retrieval step then prompt-based prediction) and includes concrete bilingual examples aligned with the paper’s cross-lingual focus. While still within conventional schematic norms, the inclusion of LRL/HRL text snippets and labeled vs. self-predicted labeling pathways reflects some adaptation to the specific contribution."
