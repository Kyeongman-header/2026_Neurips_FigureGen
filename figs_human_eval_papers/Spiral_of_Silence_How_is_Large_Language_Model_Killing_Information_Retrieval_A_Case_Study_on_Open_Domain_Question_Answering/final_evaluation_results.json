              "score": 0.55,
              "reason": "The figure captures the core iterative loop (human-authored content vs AIGC, datastore updates, search/retrieval results feeding prompts to LLMs, and temporal evolution) and the high-level emergence of a “spiral of silence.” However, it omits many major paper elements needed for full coverage: the formalization f:(Q×D×K)→S and retrieval function R:(Q×D)→D′, the specific retrieval/reranking methods and evaluation setup (ODQA metrics, iteration protocol details), and the measured short-term vs long-term effects. So it is informative at a conceptual level but not comprehensive with respect to the paper’s key technical components."

              "score": 0.75,
              "reason": "Yes, at a general level: it visually conveys an iterative RAG pipeline where LLMs generate content that is added back into a datastore and subsequently retrieved, with time leading to increasing dominance of AIGC and reduced visibility of human content. Still, some parts are ambiguous without the paper (e.g., what HGC/AIGC precisely denote operationally, what “search” returns, what the smiley-to-frowny progression quantitatively represents, and how the loop is evaluated), limiting fully standalone understanding."

              "score": 0.35,
              "reason": "The figure functions more as an overview/teaser of the central hypothesis and simulation loop rather than a summary of the entire paper. It does not include key experimental findings (e.g., short-term retrieval gains vs long-term degradation, QA stability), detailed analyses explaining ranking bias toward LLM text, ablations/conditions, datasets/benchmarks, or implications/mitigations. Thus it does not summarize the paper from start to finish."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "The figure is a high-level schematic consistent with the described simulation loop (human content + AIGC/LLM-generated content entering a datastore, searched to provide retrieval results used in prompting LLMs, then updates back into the datastore over time). It does not introduce specific algorithms, equations, or unsupported formulas. Minor risk: the pictorial elements (smiley faces, time arrow, icons) are illustrative rather than explicitly defined in text, but they do not assert new technical components beyond the paper’s narrative."

              "score": 0.85,
              "reason": "The relationships shown match the paper’s iterative retrieval–generation–integration cycle: questions trigger retrieval over a datastore; retrieved context is used to prompt LLMs to generate documents/answers; generated text is added back to the corpus for subsequent cycles, producing time-evolving effects. The depiction of two update streams (HGC and AIGC) and the gradual dominance/visibility shift over time aligns with the claimed “Spiral of Silence” emergence. Slight underspecification: the paper distinguishes retrieval and re-ranking and evaluates ODQA performance; these details are abstracted away, but not contradicted."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "Key labels are consistent with the paper’s terminology: HGC (human-generated content), AIGC (AI-generated content), LLMs, prompt, retrieval results, datastore, update, search, and time/iteration. While the paper frames the task as ODQA and RAG, those exact labels are not prominent in the figure itself; however, the labels used are not incorrect or misleading relative to the described pipeline."

              "reason": "The figure is generally easy to parse at a high level (left-to-right flow: questions/humans/LLMs → updates to datastore → search → retrieval results; plus a time-evolution panel illustrating the emerging effect). However, readability is reduced by several factors: (i) small text and thin strokes that may become illegible at typical paper zoom levels (e.g., HGC/AIGC labels, “Update,” “Data Store,” “Retrieval Results”); (ii) multiple icon styles and colors without an explicit legend, making semantics (e.g., green vs. purple documents, smiley/neutral/sad faces) somewhat ambiguous; and (iii) visual clutter from decorative icons and repeated elements, which competes with the main message. The caption helps, but the time-evolution panel still requires inference about what exactly changes over time."

              "reason": "Core pipeline elements (LLMs, prompt, retrieval results, search, datastore) are grouped in the central area, and the time-evolution panel is separated on the right; however, some related inputs/updates (HGC/AIGC and update arrows) feel slightly scattered around the datastore."

              "reason": "Major blocks (datastore cylinder, right panel) are reasonably placed, but many icons and labels (question, humans, HGC/AIGC sheets, arrows, laptop) are not consistently aligned, giving a somewhat ad-hoc layout."

              "reason": "The datastore and right-side evolution panel are visually dominant and central, helping emphasize main ideas; however, the retrieval/LLM interaction region has multiple similarly weighted icons, making the primary pathway less salient."

              "reason": "Document types (HGC vs AIGC) use consistent paper icons and distinct colors; repeated 'update' labeling is consistent. Still, mixed icon styles (humans, laptop, robot, datastore cylinder) and varying arrow styles/colors slightly reduce visual uniformity."

              "score": 0.78,
              "reason": "The figure uses clear iconographic metaphors (human vs. LLM, document stacks for corpora, database cylinder for datastore, magnifying-glass/search, prompt arrow, time arrow, emotive faces indicating system state) to concretize the abstract retrieval–generation feedback loop and the emerging “spiral of silence” dynamic. Some elements remain only lightly metaphorized (e.g., document colors for HGC/AIGC are not inherently meaningful without legend/context)."

              "score": 0.52,
              "reason": "While the conceptual framing (spiral-of-silence applied to RAG evolution) is distinctive, the visual language largely follows common schematic/flowchart conventions seen in ML papers (standard icons, arrows, database cylinder, stacked documents). The inclusion of sentiment faces and the right-side “time” panel adds some differentiation, but the overall style remains close to familiar templates."

              "score": 0.66,
              "reason": "The composition is tailored to the paper’s narrative by combining (i) a process diagram of the RAG loop on the left and (ii) a temporal evolution panel on the right to emphasize gradual dominance effects—this is more adapted than a single generic pipeline. However, it still relies on a fairly standard left-to-right flow with a boxed inset, rather than introducing a more unconventional structure (e.g., explicitly spiral/feedback visual geometry) that would further depart from uniform design."
