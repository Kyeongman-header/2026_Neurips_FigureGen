              "score": 0.82,
              "reason": "The figure captures the core FaST pipeline and its major components: (a) feature discovery from the questionnaire via a prompted LLM, (b) feature-wise scoring of responses via feature functions, (c) learning user-specific feature weights to form a feature-aware reward model (FaRM) shown as a weighted sum, and (d) sampling candidates, ranking with FaRM, and fine-tuning a generator (explicitly mentioning SFT/DPO). However, it omits methodological specifics that are likely major in the paper (e.g., concrete loss/objective for weight learning, details of the compositional preference model instantiation, how ranking data is formed, iteration schedule/termination, and any baselines/experimental setup), so it is not fully comprehensive w.r.t. all major formulas/components discussed in the full paper."

              "score": 0.88,
              "reason": "Yes: the step-by-step flow is visually clear, labeled (a)-(d), and shows inputs/outputs at each stage (questionnaire → discovered features → per-response feature scores → user preference labels → learned weights → reward model → sampling/ranking → fine-tuned LLM). The example question/answers and feature names make the intuition accessible. Some details remain unclear without text (e.g., how features are precisely elicited, how weights are optimized from pairwise choices, and what the ranking criterion/thresholding is), but the overall operating principle is understandable."

              "score": 0.35,
              "reason": "No: the figure is an overview of the proposed method (FaST) rather than a full-paper summary. It does not include the broader PPALLI problem framing, dataset introductions (DnD/ELIP), evaluation tasks (preference prediction, personalized generation), comparative baselines, metrics, experimental findings, ablations, or conclusions/limitations. It summarizes the method section well but not the entire paper end-to-end."

              "score": 0.92,
              "reason": "The figure content aligns with the described FaST pipeline: feature discovery using an LLM (GPT-4o), feature-wise response scoring via prompted LLM feature functions, learning user-specific feature weights to form a feature-weighted reward model (FaRM), and a sampling-and-tuning loop with SFT or DPO. The only mild risk is that the explicit example feature list (e.g., humor, brevity, precision, technical_detail, visual_imagery) and the exact numeric feature scores shown are illustrative; however, they are consistent with the paper’s stated use of interpretable features and scoring responses along feature dimensions."

              "score": 0.95,
              "reason": "The dependencies are correctly depicted: questionnaire → feature discovery → feature functions used to score responses → user preferences used to learn weights → FaRM formed as a weighted average of feature functions → FaRM ranks sampled responses → ranked samples used for LLM fine-tuning (e.g., SFT/DPO) in an iterative sampling-and-tuning procedure. This matches the textual description of steps (a)-(d) and the role of FaRM in ranking for tuning."

              "score": 0.96,
              "reason": "Major labels match the paper terminology: FaST, Feature-aware Reward Model (FaRM), feature discovery, feature-wise response scoring, feature weight learning, sampling & tuning, and the use of SFT/DPO. The inclusion of “Prompted GPT-4o” for feature discovery is consistent with the paper’s stated choice in experiments, and “Prompted LLM” for feature scoring is consistent with the described prompted LLM-based feature functions."

              "score": 0.84,
              "reason": "The diagram cleanly decomposes FaST into the four core stages (feature discovery, feature-wise scoring, weight learning, sampling & tuning) and visually separates user-specific steps (red dashed region), which highlights the main contribution. Some micro-details (example question text blocks, multiple icons, and small per-feature numeric scores) add specificity but slightly dilute the high-level schematic focus."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "As an overview figure, it matches the caption and likely maps well onto the method section: the flow, inputs/outputs, and where personalization enters are immediately legible. The example (civil engineering question) grounds the abstractions, aiding comprehension. Minor readability friction comes from small font sizes in embedded text boxes, which may reduce usefulness when viewed at paper scale."

              "score": 0.78,
              "reason": "Most visual elements support the pipeline (arrows, labeled blocks, user-specific boundary). However, several decorative/low-information components (multiple stylized icons, repeated question/response text across panels, flame/branding-like symbols) and detailed example snippets may be more than needed for conveying the core method, introducing mild redundancy."

              "score": 0.95,
              "reason": "The pipeline is clearly organized left-to-right with labeled stages (a)→(d) and arrows indicating progression; substeps inside the red dashed user-specific region also follow the same direction."

              "score": 0.85,
              "reason": "Most connectors are routed cleanly with minimal overlap; there are a few places (notably around the feature functions/score blocks feeding into weight learning and the sampling/ranking loop) where arrows come close and create mild visual congestion, but true crossings are largely avoided."

              "reason": "Each stage’s artifacts (inputs/outputs) are clustered (questionnaire, discovered features, feature-wise scoring, weight learning, sampling/tuning). The red dashed region effectively groups user-specific steps, reinforcing functional grouping."

              "score": 0.8,
              "reason": "Major blocks are generally aligned in columns across stages, but some internal elements (small callouts/icons and intermediate boxes) have slightly uneven vertical alignment, making the layout feel a bit busy rather than strictly grid-regular."

              "reason": "Primary stages are clearly labeled (a–d) and occupy dominant positions; the red dashed box emphasizes user-specific steps; key outputs (FaRM, fine-tuned LLM) are visually prominent via dedicated boxes and placement."

              "score": 0.75,
              "reason": "Overall spacing is adequate, but several regions are dense (especially within the user-specific dashed area and around the multiple questionnaire/response boxes), reducing whitespace and slightly impacting readability."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "Similar module types use consistent rounded-rectangle containers and recurring color cues (e.g., questionnaires, feature-related boxes, and action/process boxes). Minor variation in iconography and emphasis styles exists but does not break overall consistency."

              "score": 0.62,
              "reason": "The pipeline stages are grounded with concrete visual metaphors (user avatar for personalization, LLM/gear icons for modeling and training, checkbox-style preference selection, ranking marks). However, most concepts remain expressed via text boxes and arrows rather than stronger symbolic encodings, and some abstractions (e.g., feature-weight learning) are still largely diagrammatic rather than metaphor-driven."

              "reason": "The figure is competently designed but largely follows a standard ML-method overview template (left-to-right workflow, boxed modules, arrows, dashed highlight for user-specific steps). The light illustration style and integrated example snippets add some distinctiveness, yet overall it resembles common conference figures for pipelines."

              "question": "5.3. Adaptability: Does it apply a layout more suitable for the specific paper, breaking away from uniform design principles?",
              "score": 0.58,
              "reason": "The layout is tailored to the method’s decomposition (a–d) and effectively uses the red dashed region to separate user-specific from global steps, plus embedded questionnaire examples to anchor PPALLI’s fixed-questionnaire setting. Still, the structure remains a conventional modular flow rather than a notably unconventional or paper-specific layout innovation."
