Figure 1. Overview of PPALLI and FaST: users answer a shared questionnaire by choosing preferred responses, then FaST discovers interpretable features, scores responses via prompted feature functions, learns user-specific feature weights to form a Feature-aware Reward Model, and iteratively samples, ranks, and fine-tunes a generation model.
