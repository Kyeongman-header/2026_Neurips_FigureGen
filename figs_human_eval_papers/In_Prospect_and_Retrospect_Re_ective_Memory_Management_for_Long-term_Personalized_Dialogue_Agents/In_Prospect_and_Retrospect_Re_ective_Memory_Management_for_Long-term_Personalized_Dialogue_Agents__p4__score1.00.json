  "caption": "Figure 3: Illustration of Retrospective Reflection. The Retriever fetches Top-K memory entries from the memory bank, which are refined by the learnable Reranker to select the Top-M most relevant entries. These entries are passed to the LLM along with the query to generate the final response. The LLM assigns binary citation scores (+1 for useful and −1 for not useful) to the retrieved memory entries based on their utility in the response. These scores are used as reward signals to update the reranker via an RL update, adapting the selection of relevant memory over time.",
