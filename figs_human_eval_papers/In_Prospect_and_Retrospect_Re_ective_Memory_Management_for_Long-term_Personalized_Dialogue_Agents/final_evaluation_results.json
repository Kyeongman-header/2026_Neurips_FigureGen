      "caption": "Figure 3: Illustration of Retrospective Reflection. The Retriever fetches Top-K memory entries from the memory bank, which are refined by the learnable Reranker to select the Top-M most relevant entries. These entries are passed to the LLM along with the query to generate the final response. The LLM assigns binary citation scores (+1 for useful and −1 for not useful) to the retrieved memory entries based on their utility in the response. These scores are used as reward signals to update the reranker via an RL update, adapting the selection of relevant memory over time.",

              "reason": "The figure clearly covers the main pipeline for Retrospective Reflection (memory bank → retriever → top-K → learnable reranker → top-M → LLM response → citation-based reward → RL update). However, it omits other major paper components (notably Prospective Reflection / topic-based multi-granularity summarization and how the memory bank is constructed/updated), and it provides no formulas or key objective details (e.g., the exact RL objective, update rule, or how citation scores are computed/normalized).

The overall principle—use LLM-attributed usefulness to refine retrieval online via RL—is understandable from the diagram and caption, though exact mechanics (what counts as a citation, how rewards are assigned, what RL algorithm) are not inferable."

              "reason": "The dataflow and dependencies are coherent: query conditions retrieval; retriever returns Top-K; reranker selects Top-M; LLM consumes query + selected memories to generate response; citation-based utility feedback is used as a reward signal to update the learnable selection mechanism via RL. This matches the caption’s stated mechanism of online refinement based on cited evidence. The only slight ambiguity is whether the RL update targets strictly the reranker (as drawn) versus a broader retriever policy, but the depicted relationship is still plausible and consistent with the caption."

Color and icon cues help differentiate frozen vs. learnable modules. Readability issues mainly come from small text (e.g., 'Top-K/M Memory Entries', 'Citation Scores', '+1/−1') that may be hard to read at typical paper column width, and the ⊕ symbol plus the placement of the Query box may require a second glance to understand how query and retrieved entries are combined.

The figure is schematic and does not encode the paper’s specific RMM mechanisms (prospective/retrospective reflection), but it also does not misstate relationships; it remains at the motivation level."

The figure does not label RMM-specific components (e.g., Prospective/Retrospective Reflection), but since it is presented as an illustration rather than the method diagram, there are no incorrect method/component names."

              "reason": "The figure is easy to parse at a glance: it clearly separates the current session (top) from past sessions (bottom) and uses arrows to indicate retrieval of relevant history. Typography is legible, contrast is strong, and the color highlights (blue/orange plus underlined keywords) effectively guide attention to the key facts (symptoms, allergy). Minor readability issues include slight visual clutter from repeated avatar/chat icons and ellipses, a somewhat dense top text bubble, and reliance on color to differentiate the two retrieved histories (could be harder for color-vision deficiencies or grayscale printing)."

              "reason": "The current session is emphasized by larger size and top placement, and colored emphasis (blue/orange/green terms) draws attention. The hierarchy is understandable, though the history cards also have heavy borders that somewhat competes with the top card’s prominence."

              "reason": "Both history elements use the same rounded-rectangle card style and similar iconography, while the current session uses a consistent card style at a larger scale.

              "reason": "The layout is tailored to the paper’s long-term personalization setting by explicitly separating 'Today', 'Yesterday', and 'A Week Ago' and showing evidence flow into the current response. Still, it remains a straightforward, standard arrangement (top current panel + lower history panels) rather than a more customized structure that conveys the paper’s specific mechanisms (e.g., prospective/retrospective reflection loops)."
