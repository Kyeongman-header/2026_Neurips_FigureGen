  "caption": "Figure 1: This figure showcases the essence of our approach. Starting from a problem in natural language, in Step 1, the LLM semantic parser samples logic formulas expressing estimates of the semantics. It is possible that some of these might contain errors, e.g., the second example shows a syntax error involving an extra parenthesis, whereas the fourth example highlights a semantic error caused by mismatched predicates. In Step 2, these are then each offloaded to an automated theorem prover, filtering out syntax errors, and producing labels for the remaining samples. In Step 3, the remaining candidate outputs are passed through a majority-vote sieve to arrive at the best estimate for a single output label.",
