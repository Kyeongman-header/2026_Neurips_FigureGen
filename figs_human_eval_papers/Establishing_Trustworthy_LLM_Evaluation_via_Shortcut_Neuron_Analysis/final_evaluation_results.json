      "caption": "Figure 2: The overview of our method. We employ neuron analysis to identify regions within the model that may be overestimating its capabilities due to shortcuts. We calculate comparative and causal scores to find shortcut neurons. The former highlights the areas where there is the greatest divergence between parameters of contaminated and uncontaminated models. The latter is derived from neuron patching analysis to assess its causal impact. Subsequently, we use the located shortcut neurons to patch various models under test to obtain trustworthy evaluation results.",

However, it omits several important specifics mentioned in the text: the exact definition/aggregation of the comparative score (only 'average distance' is stated), the two causal criteria for shortcut neurons (restore true scores AND not affect normal ability), details of selecting the sparse neuron set (e.g., thresholds/top-k), and the use of a base model with the same architecture as the patch source is only implicitly shown.

              "reason": "A reader can infer the high-level idea: compare activations between contaminated and uncontaminated models, identify neurons that differ and have causal effect via patching, then patch those neurons during evaluation to reduce shortcut-driven overestimation. Nevertheless, several steps are not self-explanatory from the diagram alone: what exactly is being patched (which activations/layers/neurons), what 'comparative score' and 'causal score' numerically mean, how the neuron set is chosen from scores, and what the bar charts represent (accuracy shifts) and under what prompts/metrics. Icons/visual metaphors help but require prior familiarity with activation patching."

It does introduce some schematic elements (e.g., explicit MHA/MLP blocks, bar charts for accuracy, paraphrase-contaminated vs real-world model icons) that are not strictly “formulas” from the text, but these are standard illustrative devices rather than new technical claims."

              "reason": "Core relationships appear consistent: (i) comparative score is derived from activation differences between contaminated and uncontaminated models on the same samples; (ii) causal score is derived from patching activations (using a base model to patch a target/patched model) and measuring causal effect on accuracy; (iii) identified shortcut neurons are then patched during inference to obtain a more trustworthy evaluation and compared against reference benchmarks. Minor ambiguity: the caption says comparative score highlights divergence between “parameters,” while the diagram computes distances over “activations,” which is likely a wording inconsistency rather than a conceptual error. Also, the diagram’s accuracy-drop depiction is qualitative and may oversimplify the two causal criteria (restore true score and not harm normal ability), which are not explicitly shown."

However, readability is reduced by high visual density and small text (e.g., token strings, module labels, and some axis/legend text), plus multiple decorative/illustrative icons that compete with the core signal. The color semantics (greens/reds/blues/purples) are not fully self-evident without careful reading, and the bottom ‘inference phase’ combines several concepts (model types, patching, and comparison to reference benchmark) into a compact strip that can be hard to parse quickly."

Readability is still acceptable but margins could be increased for breathing room."

However, the semantic meaning of some colors (e.g., green vs red neuron blocks across panels; purple vs green bar charts) is not fully explicit, and multiple icon styles introduce slight inconsistency."
