  "caption": "Figure 2: The overview of our method. We employ neuron analysis to identify regions within the model that may be overestimating its capabilities due to shortcuts. We calculate comparative and causal scores to find shortcut neurons. The former highlights the areas where there is the greatest divergence between parameters of contaminated and uncontaminated models. The latter is derived from neuron patching analysis to assess its causal impact. Subsequently, we use the located shortcut neurons to patch various models under test to obtain trustworthy evaluation results.",
