              "reason": "The figure conveys the core intuition that distillation utility depends on the specific reasoning path, the task, and the student model, and it depicts multiple black-box teachers producing multiple reasoning paths with varying effectiveness for different students. However, it omits most major method components described in the paper (e.g., quality filtering via correctness + LLM-as-judge scoring, conditional routing via a trainable router, cooperative/peer teaching with ensemble and feature-level mutual distillation losses), and includes no formulas or training objective details."

              "reason": "A reader can infer the high-level problem statement: different teacher-generated reasoning paths help or hurt depending on task and student, motivating selective use of paths. But the operating principle of the proposed system is not clear from the figure: there is no depiction of how paths are filtered, how routing decisions are made, how multiple students collaborate/teach each other, or what signals are optimized during training."

It also depicts explicit per-path/per-student success/failure outcomes (green checks/red Xs) as if measured, but the excerpt only motivates that effectiveness is path/task/student dependent without defining such a concrete evaluation setup in Figure 1.

              "reason": "The core relationship claimed by the caption—distillation effectiveness depends on the reasoning path, the task, and the student—is correctly conveyed by showing two different questions (tasks), multiple reasoning paths from a black-box LLM, and different students benefiting/hurting depending on the path. However, the paper’s overall method includes quality filtering, conditional routing, and peer teaching; those relationships are not represented here (which is fine for Figure 1) but the figure’s strong implication of path assignment/selection and binary effectiveness outcomes goes beyond what the excerpt specifies for this illustrative figure."

But using brand/model names (Gemini/ChatGPT) is not supported by the provided text, and the figure does not label QR-Distill components (quality filtering, conditional routing, cooperative distillation), so it is only partially aligned with the paper’s named methods."

However, readability is reduced by small text in the prompt boxes and student labels, mixed iconography (graduation emoji, robot heads, provider logos) that competes for attention, and somewhat unclear grouping/alignment (which exact dimension corresponds to task vs. teacher vs. path) without stronger headings or separators. Color/contrast is generally acceptable, but the figure feels dense for its size and would benefit from fewer decorative elements and clearer labeling of axes/sections."

              "reason": "The top-to-bottom placement suggests hierarchy, and the central 'Black-box LLM' is prominent. Still, similar visual weight across many boxes/icons (prompts, paths, student outcomes) makes the primary message compete with decorative elements and repeated structures."

              "reason": "Repeated components (reasoning path boxes, student panels, check/cross indicators) are consistently styled.

              "reason": "The figure uses concrete visual metaphors to encode abstract ideas: teacher models as branded logos (Gemini/ChatGPT), students as robot icons, distillation effectiveness as green checkmarks/red crosses, and tasks as illustrated question cards. These symbols reduce conceptual load and convey dependency relationships (path/task/student) without heavy text, though some parts still rely on textual labels like “Reasoning Path 1/2.”"

However, the overall visual language remains close to common “pipeline + outcomes grid” schematics, and the use of stock-like icons/logos is familiar rather than stylistically original."

              "reason": "The layout is tailored to the paper’s key claim (effectiveness depends on path/task/student) by juxtaposing multiple tasks and teachers on top with a per-student effectiveness matrix below, rather than a generic linear pipeline. Still, it follows a fairly standard top-to-bottom causal flow and modular blocks; it adapts content well, but doesn’t strongly break from conventional figure composition."

This matches the two-pass description (teacher-driven routing then peer-teaching via an ensemble). Minor ambiguity: the figure suggests routing decisions directly determine which student receives which paths (correct), but it also visually implies a simultaneous mutual distillation between students plus an ensemble, whereas the text frames peer teaching through an ensemble bottleneck; the exact directionality/structure may be somewhat simplified."

However, readability is reduced by (i) dense visual clutter (many arrows, check/X markers, repeated student/robot elements), (ii) small text in several labels (e.g., internal box text, vertical 'Reasoning Path Router', 'Weight Learner'), (iii) heavy patterned backgrounds that compete with foreground text, and (iv) decorative emoji-style graphics that add noise without improving legibility. Overall, the structure is understandable but would benefit from simplified visuals, higher text size/contrast, and fewer competing graphical elements."
