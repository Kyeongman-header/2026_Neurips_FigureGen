              "reason": "The key contrast (Image vs Image + Inst. Overlay) is visually prominent via side-by-side placement and colored highlighting on the manipulated panel. The output scores (3.5 vs 4.1) are large and salient, though the figure is somewhat text-heavy and the most important causal link (overlay → higher score) could be emphasized more explicitly."

              "reason": "The two pipelines use consistent iconography (same LVLM judge robot), similar arrow style, and parallel structure. The two example images use consistent framing; color is used consistently to mark the manipulated condition. Minor inconsistencies exist in typography/label styling across sections (screenshot-like headers vs diagram labels)."

The styling (labels, arrows, icon, score callouts) is familiar and functional rather than distinctive or unusually creative."

              "reason": "The layout is tailored to the paper’s core claim (visual manipulation inflates LVLM scoring) by directly juxtaposing the manipulation (instruction overlay) with the downstream score change in a single, easily scannable narrative. While still within standard figure conventions, it adapts the arrangement to emphasize the causal story (manipulation → judge confusion → higher score) effectively."

It functions well alongside the caption/text because each row provides a concise definition plus a paired visual example that concretizes the manipulation. However, readability is moderately limited by small thumbnail images and fine overlaid text (especially in the instruction/keyword overlay examples), which may become illegible at typical paper zoom levels; several examples rely on subtle visual differences (brightness/gamma) that are hard to perceive without larger images or explicit parameter annotations. The design is largely non-decorative, but the repeated arrows and many rows create visual density; stronger row spacing, larger thumbnails, or callouts/zoom-ins for text-overlay rows would improve scannability."
