The figure communicates that the system detects edits between snapshots, generates QA, then filters for true updates and non-hallucinated answers.

No extra formulas or unsupported modules are introduced; the only minor potential issue is that the figure visually implies a specific prompt structure (system/message blocks, entity lists) that may be more detailed than what is explicitly stated in the excerpt, but it remains consistent with an LLM-prompt-based pipeline."

This matches the paper’s stated process of extracting edited parts via difflib, generating QA with GPT-3.5, and validating/filtering with LLM. A small ambiguity is that the excerpt does not specify the exact order or granularity of filters, but the depicted relations are plausible and aligned with the described intent."

Minor possible mismatch is that the excerpt names difflib explicitly while the figure labels the step more generally as extraction of edited text and named entities, but this is not a labeling error—just a higher-level description."

              "reason": "The layout is adapted to the paper’s method: it explicitly mirrors the EDITED construction with paired time snapshots, entity lists, then QA generation and two filtering checks, which makes the temporal-editing premise immediately legible. Still, it remains within conventional left-to-right pipeline organization and standard box-and-arrow design rather than a more custom or unconventional arrangement."
