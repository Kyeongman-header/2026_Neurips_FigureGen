  "caption": "Figure 1: In contrast to conventional discrete diffusion models, DiffusionBERT uses BERT as its backbone to perform text generation. The main differences are highlighted in color: (1) DiffusionBERT performs decoding without knowing the current time step while canonical diffusion models are conditioned on time step. (2) The diffusion process of DiffusionBERT is non-Markovian in that it generates noise samples xt conditioning not only on xt−1 but also on x0. Such a non-Markov process is due to our proposed noise schedule.",
