      "caption": "Figure 1: In contrast to conventional discrete diffusion models, DiffusionBERT uses BERT as its backbone to perform text generation. The main differences are highlighted in color: (1) DiffusionBERT performs decoding without knowing the current time step while canonical diffusion models are conditioned on time step. (2) The diffusion process of DiffusionBERT is non-Markovian in that it generates noise samples xt conditioning not only on xt−1 but also on x0. Such a non-Markov process is due to our proposed noise schedule.",

However, it omits most major technical components emphasized in the paper such as the specific discrete transition-matrix formulation (Qt), the absorbing-state setup, the spindle noise schedule details, objective/ELBO terms, and the various time-step incorporation designs/ablations. So it covers the conceptual delta but not the major formal machinery."

The caption and visual examples help. Still, details like what 'time-agnostic decoding' precisely entails, how x0 is used in the forward process, and what the noise schedule is are not understandable beyond the headline level."

Minor ambiguity: the diagram suggests the forward process itself is q(x_t|x_{t−1},x_0) (non-Markov), whereas standard diffusion formulations often keep a Markov forward process but allow closed-form q(x_t|x_0); however, the paper text explicitly states their spindle schedule makes the forward process non-Markovian, so the depiction is largely consistent."
