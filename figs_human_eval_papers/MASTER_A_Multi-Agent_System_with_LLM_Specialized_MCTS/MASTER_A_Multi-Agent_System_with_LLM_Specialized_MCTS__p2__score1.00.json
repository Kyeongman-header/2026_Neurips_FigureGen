Its child agent Agent3 is a terminal agent that failed evaluation which triggers a backpropagation and lowers the UCT of Agent1. Now Agent2 has the highest UCT and is selected for next expansion. Its child agent, Agent6 is a terminal agent and passes evaluation. The answer in it is the final answer.",
