      "caption": "Figure 1: Reasoning Tree of MASTER. Starting from Agent0, Agent1 and Agent2 are created in the first expansion. Then the system first selects Agent1 for expansion due to its higher UCT. Its child agent Agent3 is a terminal agent that failed evaluation which triggers a backpropagation and lowers the UCT of Agent1. Now Agent2 has the highest UCT and is selected for next expansion. Its child agent, Agent6 is a terminal agent and passes evaluation. The answer in it is the final answer.",

              "score": 0.62,
              "reason": "The figure covers the core algorithmic loop of MASTER’s LLM-specialized MCTS (selection via UCT, expansion, terminal evaluation, backpropagation) and the per-agent pipeline (Thought/Action/Observation/Validation/Assessment/Evaluation) plus the multi-agent parent→child structure. However, it does not expose key details that are typically “major components” in such a paper: the exact UCT form, the reward definition/self-evaluation weighting by confidence, how validation/assessment differ operationally, stopping criteria/budgeting, and any dataset/task-specific tool interfaces. Thus it captures the high-level architecture but omits important formal/mechanistic specifics."

              "score": 0.8,
              "reason": "Yes at a high level: it depicts a tree of agents, UCT-based selection, creation of child agents on expansion, terminal evaluation outcomes (pass/fail), and backpropagation updating node values/visits; it also shows the internal agent workflow and that terminal agents produce candidate answers. Some ambiguity remains without the paper (what exactly constitutes “Evaluation” vs “Assessment,” what tools/actions are available, and what the reward signal is), but the overall operating principle is understandable."

              "reason": "The figure is a method diagram rather than a full-paper summary. It does not cover experiments, benchmarks (HotpotQA/WebShop/MBPP), metrics/results, baselines, ablations, implementation details, limitations, or broader claims. It captures the central mechanism but not the end-to-end narrative of the paper."

              "score": 0.93,
              "reason": "The figure content aligns with the paper’s described MASTER workflow: agent recruitment/expansion, UCT-based selection, terminal evaluation, and backpropagation of value/visits; and the LLM-based steps (reasoning/action, observation via tools, validation, assessment/self-reward, evaluation). It does not introduce extraneous equations or unfamiliar modules beyond these described concepts. Minor risk: the explicit UCT numeric values and the specific sequence of agents (Agent0–Agent6) look illustrative rather than empirically derived, but they function as an example consistent with MCTS-style exposition rather than a new, unsupported component."

              "question": "2.2. Relation Correctness: Are the relationships between major components or formulas mentioned in the paper accurately represented?",
              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "Relationships match an MCTS-like loop adapted to LLMs: selection (by UCT) → expansion (recruit child agent) → terminal evaluation → backpropagation updating nodes along the path, and iterative re-selection after updating. The parent/child agent linkage and the idea that a failed terminal evaluation lowers the selected agent’s standing (via updated value/visits affecting UCT) are consistent with standard MCTS and the paper’s claim of retaining backpropagation for reward correction. Slight ambiguity: the diagram’s linear pipeline (Thought/Action/Observation/Validation/Assessment/Evaluation) suggests a fixed ordering inside each agent; the paper description (as provided) emphasizes removing simulation and using self-evaluation + extra context/confidence weighting—those specific mechanisms (e.g., confidence weighting) are not depicted, but the shown relations are not contradictory."

              "score": 0.95,
              "reason": "Key labels are accurate and consistent with the paper context: MASTER reasoning tree framing, UCT for selection, Expansion and Backpropagation, Parent/Child Agent, Terminal Agent with pass/fail evaluation, and the LLM-centric stages (validation/assessment/evaluation). No major misnaming is evident. The only minor issue is that “Assessment” is described as estimating initial reward, which matches the narrative of LLM self-evaluation, but the paper’s additional reward-objectivity refinements (e.g., confidence weighting) are not labeled here."

              "score": 0.72,
              "reason": "The figure captures the core idea—an MCTS-style reasoning tree over agents plus the parent/child agent workflow stages (thought/action/observation/validation/assessment/evaluation). However, it includes many per-node UCT numbers and step-specific highlights that are hard to parse at typical paper zoom levels and add detail beyond the main contribution, slightly diluting the schematic focus."

              "score": 0.8,
              "reason": "As a companion to the caption, the left panel’s example tree (selection → expansion → terminal evaluation → backpropagation) plus the right panel’s pipeline clarifies how MASTER differs from standard MCTS (explicit evaluation stages, terminal agent concept). Some readability friction remains because the small labels/UCT values and multiple legend elements require effort to connect to the narrative, but overall it supports comprehension."

              "score": 0.68,
              "reason": "The diagram is mostly functional, but several elements feel redundant for readability: repeated robot icons and color/shape encodings, numerous UCT values on each node, and dual presentation of the figure (a dense top version and a cleaner bottom version in the provided image). These increase visual clutter without proportionate explanatory gain."

              "score": 0.85,
              "reason": "The overall narrative is left-to-right: the reasoning tree is on the left and the parent/child agent process panel is on the right, with arrows indicating progression. Within the tree, the growth is also top-down. Minor ambiguity arises because selection/backpropagation cues are distributed and not strictly sequential in one axis."

              "reason": "Most connections are clean, but several diagonal edges in the tree converge/cross visually near Agent2’s descendants and around the multi-colored arrows for expansion/backpropagation, creating local clutter and potential confusion."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "Tree nodes are grouped as a coherent structure and the legend sits nearby; the process steps (Thought/Action/Observation/Validation/Assessment/Evaluation) are clustered inside the Parent Agent panel with clear adjacency to the ‘Context’ box. The two main modules (tree vs. process) are separated but connected with a linking arrow, which is appropriate."

              "score": 0.65,
              "reason": "The right panel is well-aligned (stacked steps, consistent spacing, clean box alignment). The left tree uses an organic layout with uneven horizontal/vertical alignment among agents and inconsistent edge angles, reducing perceived neatness."

              "score": 0.8,
              "reason": "The two primary components are strongly separated by large bordered panels; the Parent Agent panel and Context box are visually prominent. In the tree, emphasis via color (selected/expanded/terminal) helps, though the root and key decision points could be more visually dominant (e.g., stronger sizing/weighting) to further clarify hierarchy."

              "score": 0.75,
              "reason": "Within the right panel, margins are comfortable. On the left, node spacing is generally adequate, but the legend area and some edge labels (UCT values) sit close to nodes/lines, and the dense central region reduces breathing room."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "Agent icons are consistently styled; role/status encoding (regular/terminal, selected/expanded, pass/fail) is handled consistently via color and overlay symbols, reinforced by a clear legend. A small deduction because multiple simultaneous encodings (color + outline + symbols + multi-colored arrows) can feel slightly overloaded even if consistent."

              "reason": "The figure concretizes agent states and MCTS operations using distinct agent icons (regular/selected/expanded/terminal) and directional arrows for expansion/backpropagation, plus the UCT abbreviation as a compact symbolic metric. However, many abstract steps (Thought/Action/Observation/Validation/Assessment/Evaluation) remain largely textual within a box rather than being further metaphorized with richer symbols."

              "reason": "The overall composition resembles common multi-agent/MCTS schematic templates: a tree with UCT labels, a legend, and a process pipeline panel. The use of small robot avatars and color-coded terminal outcomes adds some personality, but it does not substantially depart from typical academic system-diagram aesthetics."

              "score": 0.7,
              "reason": "The split layout (left: concrete reasoning-tree example with UCT changes; right: per-agent internal workflow and context/solution slots) is tailored to explaining MASTER’s key contributions—agent recruitment/selection plus LLM-based evaluation replacing simulation. The inclusion of a worked selection/backpropagation narrative improves task-specific clarity beyond a generic block diagram, though the design still follows standard conventions (tree + pipeline + legend)."
