  "caption": "Figure 1: Overview: given user-specified error tolerance λ, error rate α, and a calibration dataset, CONFLVLM returns a more reliable response for any new image and prompt at inference time through sampling, decomposing D, filtering F , and merging M , to ensure that the risk of the final response Y ∗ is controlled with high probability. Illustrative examples, one for each application domain, are provided for outcome demonstration, where claims are highlighted to indicate CONFLVLM’s confidence using specific conformity score and error tolerance level. Unhighlighted claims correspond to low confidence in factuality check.",
