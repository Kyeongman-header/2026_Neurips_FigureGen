  "caption": "Figure 1: An illustration on inference framework and contrastive decoding process of ICD method. At the core (middle orange box), the framework integrates a frozen image encoder, LLM, and query vectors (gray box) within the Q-Former, focusing solely on adjusting the standard and disturbance instructions. The latter, exemplified by adding role prefixes like ‘You are a confused object detector,’ aims to increase multimodal alignment uncertainty. This results in two distinct distributions: one from the standard instruction and another influenced by the disturbance. The contrastive decoding method (right orange box) highlights how disturbance instructions amplify hallucinated concepts (‘person and fork’), which are then corrected by subtracting probabilities derived from the standard instruction, ensuring accurate recognition of the correct concept ‘dog’.",
