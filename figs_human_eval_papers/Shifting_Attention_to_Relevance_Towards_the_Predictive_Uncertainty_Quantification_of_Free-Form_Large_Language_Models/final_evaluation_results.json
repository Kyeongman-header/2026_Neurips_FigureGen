      "caption": "Figure 1: Irrelevant tokens (or sentences) may commit majority uncertainty in free-form generations, such as the token “of” committing extremely large uncertainty misleads the uncertainty quantification of LLMs. We term these observations as generative inequalities and tackle them by shifting attention to more relevant components.",

              "score": 0.55,
              "reason": "The figure clearly contrasts baseline predictive-entropy UQ (uniform token averaging) with the proposed SAR idea (reweighting/shifting attention toward relevant tokens), illustrating token entropies, an example weighting vector, and the resulting uncertainty difference. However, it omits other major paper components referenced in the context (e.g., sentence-level shifting, how relevance is computed via semantic change on token removal, semantic-entropy clustering baselines, experimental setup across datasets/LLMs, and any formal definitions/algorithms beyond the toy arithmetic)."

              "score": 0.78,
              "reason": "From the figure alone, a reader can infer the core principle: token-wise uncertainty (entropy) can be dominated by semantically weak tokens; SAR reduces this by applying relevance-based weights so uncertainty better reflects meaningful tokens, changing the accept/refuse decision. Still, the mechanism for deriving the relevance weights (why those specific weights, how computed, whether normalized, and how it generalizes beyond this example) is not explained within the figure."

              "score": 0.22,
              "reason": "The figure serves as a motivating example and high-level intuition for SAR, not a full-paper summary. It does not cover the broader scope (token- and sentence-level methods, relation to prior work like semantic entropy, evaluation protocol, results, demographic analysis, limitations, etc.), so it cannot be considered complete with respect to the paper’s full narrative."

              "score": 0.95,
              "reason": "The figure’s elements (example question/answer, token entropies, averaging/summing into an overall uncertainty, and SAR token-level shifting via reweighting) are consistent with the paper context and caption describing token-level generative inequality and shifting attention to relevant components. No clearly extraneous methods or metrics are introduced. Minor concern: the exact numeric weights (e.g., 0.757, 0.057, etc.) and the precise aggregation presentation could be illustrative rather than explicitly specified in the provided excerpt, but they align with the stated SAR idea."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "The depicted relationship—that predictive-entropy UQ treats tokens equally (uniform averaging of token entropies) and that SAR reweights token contributions based on relevance to reduce overemphasis on irrelevant tokens—is faithful to the described motivation and method. The causal narrative (high entropy on an irrelevant token like “of” inflates overall uncertainty; relevance-shifting lowers it) matches the caption. Slight ambiguity: the figure shows an average (divide by 4) and then a relevance-weighted combination; the paper excerpt does not confirm the exact aggregation form, but the qualitative relationship is correct."

              "score": 0.98,
              "reason": "Key labels match the paper: “Predictive Entropy-based Uncertainty Quantification,” “Shifting Attention to Relevance (SAR) Uncertainty Quantification,” “Token Entropy,” and “Token-Level Shifting.” The example framing (LLM generation vs ground truth; correctness) and the term “irrelevant tokens” align with the caption and narrative."

              "score": 0.72,
              "reason": "The figure clearly contrasts baseline predictive-entropy UQ vs SAR with a concrete token-level example, which directly communicates the main contribution (reweighting uncertainty by relevance). However, it includes several small numeric details (per-token entropies, division by 4, intermediate sums) that increase cognitive load and may not be strictly necessary to convey the core idea at a glance."

              "score": 0.86,
              "reason": "It aligns well with the caption/text: it illustrates the claim that irrelevant tokens can dominate uncertainty and shows how SAR shifts attention to relevant tokens to correct the decision outcome. The step-by-step layout (question/GT, generation, baseline outcome, SAR outcome) supports comprehension when referenced in the narrative."

              "score": 0.58,
              "reason": "There are multiple decorative or non-essential elements that mildly distract from the core message (e.g., icons/emojis, checkmark styling, heavy color blocks/borders). Some repeated text (e.g., 'LLMs Generation' plus the same tokens repeated across panels) and detailed arithmetic presentation could be simplified without loss of meaning."

              "score": 0.85,
              "reason": "The figure reads clearly top-to-bottom: question/GT at top, then baseline UQ panel, then SAR panel. Within each panel, the token-entropy aggregation proceeds left-to-right using plus signs and arrows, though the mixture of vertical sectioning and horizontal equations makes the primary direction slightly mixed."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "Tokens, their entropies, and their aggregation are co-located within each panel; the two methods are separated into distinct stacked panels, making comparison easy. Minor distance exists between token boxes and their numeric weights in the SAR panel, but correspondence remains clear."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "Token boxes form a clean row; numbers and operators are largely aligned and evenly spaced; panel headers and borders follow a consistent grid. Slight misalignment/uneven spacing appears around the per-token multipliers and the final division/aggregation expression."

              "score": 0.85,
              "reason": "Section headers, colored result boxes (high vs low uncertainty), and arrows create clear visual emphasis, and the baseline vs SAR comparison is structurally prominent. However, visual weight is somewhat shared with decorative icons (LLM/logo/emojis), slightly diluting emphasis on the quantitative mechanism."

              "score": 0.78,
              "reason": "Overall spacing is adequate, but the figure is dense: token boxes, numbers, operators, and icons are packed tightly, especially within the panels. Borders and separators help, yet additional white space would improve legibility at smaller print sizes."
            },
            {
              "question": "4.7. Consistency: Are components with similar roles represented with the same shape and color?",
              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "Tokens are consistently shown as similar cyan boxes across both panels; uncertainty outcomes use consistent colored callouts (red for high, green for low). Minor inconsistency comes from mixed iconography/styles (logos, emojis) and slightly different presentation of per-token weighting vs per-token entropy between panels."

              "score": 0.62,
              "reason": "The figure concretizes “uncertainty” and “relevance shifting” via token boxes, arithmetic aggregation, and color-coded outcome panels (high vs low uncertainty), plus simple icons (check/sad/neutral) to signal correctness/decision. However, the metaphoric mapping remains fairly literal (numbers and equations dominate), and the icons are minimal rather than a richer symbolic system for the abstract concepts."

              "score": 0.48,
              "reason": "It uses a familiar ML-paper infographic style: stacked panels, highlighted tokens, arrows, and red/green decision boxes. The token-level weighting visualization is clear but not especially distinctive; the overall aesthetic resembles common explanatory figures in NLP/LLM papers with modest customization."

              "question": "5.3. Adaptability: Does it apply a layout more suitable for the specific paper, breaking away from uniform design principles?",
              "score": 0.71,
              "reason": "The side-by-side/stacked comparison directly supports the paper’s thesis by contrasting baseline entropy aggregation vs SAR with the same tokens and entropies, and by explicitly showing the reweighting coefficients and the changed final uncertainty/decision. This is tailored to the argument (token-level inequality) rather than a generic results plot, though it still follows standard panel-based structure."
