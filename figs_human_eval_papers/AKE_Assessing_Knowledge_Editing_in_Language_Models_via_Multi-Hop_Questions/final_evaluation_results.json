However, it omits most major components of the paper beyond dataset specification—e.g., evaluation protocol/metrics, experimental settings, baselines (ROME/MEMIT, etc.), and the proposed MeLLo method.

              "reason": "As a standalone, it is fairly intelligible: it demonstrates an edit set that changes intermediate facts, shows the resulting change in the correct answer, and provides the underlying reasoning chain pre/post edit. A reader can infer the benchmark’s operating principle (multi-hop questions whose answers should change after edits).

It does not introduce extraneous methods, equations, or components beyond what the paper defines (edits, questions, pre/post answers, pre/post chains).

              "reason": "Relationships are represented consistently: E specifies counterfactual edits; C is the pre-edit chain supporting answer a; C* reflects applying edits to yield the post-edit chain supporting answer a*; Q are paraphrased multi-hop questions targeting the tail entity of the chain. This aligns with the paper’s definition of chains and entailed-answer change under edits.

              "reason": "The figure covers the core components of MeLLo (multi-hop question decomposition, subquestion answering, retrieval from an edited-fact memory, contradiction checking, and answer updating). However, it omits other major paper elements (e.g., the MQUAKE benchmark construction/details, evaluation settings, metrics, compared editors, scaling experiments) and provides no formalism (e.g., the paper’s fact-triple/edit notation). Thus it is informative for MeLLo’s pipeline but not for the paper’s full technical content."

Color-coding and arrows help explain control/data flow. Some specifics remain underspecified (how decomposition is done, retrieval mechanism, contradiction criterion), but the high-level method is understandable standalone."

It does not summarize the broader paper narrative (motivation, benchmark definition and datasets, experimental protocol, results showing failures of weight-editing baselines, quantitative comparisons, limitations). As a paper-level summary from start to end, it is incomplete."

It does not introduce mathematical formulas or clearly unrelated modules. Minor risk: the illustration uses specific example facts (e.g., 'The capital of the US is Seattle', 'CEO of Apple is Carlos Slim') that are not necessarily paper-specific and could be viewed as illustrative fabrications rather than documented examples, but they function as placeholders consistent with the method."

Minor issues are typographic/wording-level (e.g., caption grammar like 'decompose' vs 'decomposes', 'Appedix'), not substantive mislabeling."

However, readability is reduced by small text in several boxes, dense content in the left panel, and reliance on color/emoji-style markers (e.g., smiley, warning) that can be hard to parse at print/PDF zoom levels and for accessibility. The dotted/solid arrow conventions are understandable but somewhat busy, and the final answer ('Ottawa') is visually distant from the key correction step, requiring extra scanning."

              "reason": "The figure uses a magnifying-glass icon to represent querying/retrieval, dashed and solid arrows to distinguish query vs. retrieval flows, and warning/contrast markers (e.g., contradiction cue) to concretize the abstract notion of consistency checking.

This is reasonably tailored to the paper’s mechanism, though it still adheres to widely used two-panel workflow patterns rather than introducing a notably unconventional or highly customized layout."
