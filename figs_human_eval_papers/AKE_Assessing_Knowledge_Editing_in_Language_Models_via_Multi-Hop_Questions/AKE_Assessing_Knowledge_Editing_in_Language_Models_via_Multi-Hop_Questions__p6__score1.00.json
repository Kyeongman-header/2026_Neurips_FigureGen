When a subquestion is generated, the base model generates a tentative answer to the subquestion. Then, the subquestion is used to retrieve a most relevant fact from the edited fact memory. The model checks if the retrieved fact contradicts the generated answer and updates the prediction accordingly. The concrete prompts used in MeLLo are shown in Appedix F.",
