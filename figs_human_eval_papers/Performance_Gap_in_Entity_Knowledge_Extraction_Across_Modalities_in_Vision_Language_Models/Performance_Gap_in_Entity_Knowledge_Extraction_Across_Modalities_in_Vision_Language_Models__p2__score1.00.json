  "caption": "Figure 2: The left pane is an illustration for the experiment in Section 5. The hidden states at the positions of the visual tokens are copied from the forward pass of the injected entity at the source layer (in this case layer 1) replacing the hidden states of the original entity’s forward pass at the same layer and position. The right pane is an illustration of the experiment in Section 6. Starting from the source layer, the hidden states at the positions of the visual tokens are copied and patched instead of the hidden states at the same positions in the subsequent layers until the target layer, effectively \"freezing\" their processing by the LLM.",
