  "caption": "Figure 1: We perform forward passes on contrastive examples of answers to multiple-choice questions, extracting residual stream activations at a particular layer at the token position of the answer. We then take the mean activation difference over many contrast pairs. At inference time, this vector is added back into the residual stream with a chosen multiplier at all token positions after the instruction to control the behavior.",
