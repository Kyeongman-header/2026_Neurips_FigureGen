      "caption": "Figure 1: We perform forward passes on contrastive examples of answers to multiple-choice questions, extracting residual stream activations at a particular layer at the token position of the answer. We then take the mean activation difference over many contrast pairs. At inference time, this vector is added back into the residual stream with a chosen multiplier at all token positions after the instruction to control the behavior.",

              "score": 0.72,
              "reason": "The figure captures the core CAA pipeline: constructing contrast pairs, extracting residual-stream activations at a chosen layer and token position, taking differences, averaging across many pairs to form a steering vector, and applying it during inference with a multiplier across post-prompt token positions. However, it omits several major paper-level components such as the evaluation setups/metrics (multiple-choice vs open-ended, GPT-4 judging), comparisons to system prompting/finetuning, analysis/geometry of vectors, robustness/transfer findings, and any formal notation or implementation details beyond the high-level mean-difference idea."

              "score": 0.88,
              "reason": "Yes: the two-panel structure clearly separates (a) how the steering vector is computed (difference at answer-token residual stream, averaged over many pairs) and (b) how it is applied (added to residual stream at a selected layer for all tokens after the instruction, scaled by a multiplier). The use of a concrete contrast-pair example (A vs B) and explicit annotations makes the operating principle largely understandable without additional text."

              "score": 0.25,
              "reason": "No. The figure is a method schematic focused on vector construction and application; it does not summarize the paper’s broader narrative (motivation, related work positioning, experimental results across behaviors, capability impact, transfer, comparisons to baselines, mechanistic interpretation methods, limitations, and conclusions). It represents one central method component rather than an end-to-end summary of the full paper."

              "score": 0.95,
              "reason": "The figure depicts only elements described in the provided paper context/caption: contrastive A/B multiple-choice prompt pairs, extracting residual stream activations at a chosen layer and at the answer-token position, taking their difference and averaging across pairs, then adding the resulting steering vector during inference with a multiplier at token positions after the instruction. No extraneous formulas or unrelated modules are introduced."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "The causal/algorithmic flow matches the text: (1) run forward passes on positive/negative contrast pairs, (2) take residual-stream activation differences at the answer-letter token position for a specific layer n, (3) average across many pairs to form a steering vector, and (4) apply it during generation by adding it to the residual stream with a scalar multiplier after the prompt/instruction to steer behavior. Minor ambiguity: the diagram’s exact intervention scope (‘all token positions after the instruction’) is shown, but whether it is at only one layer n vs potentially multiple layers is not emphasized beyond the single-layer depiction."

              "score": 0.95,
              "reason": "Key labels align with the paper’s terminology: 'contrast pair', 'positive/negative example of behavior', 'Transformer residual stream', 'Layer n', 'difference in residual stream activations at token position of answer letter', 'average over many pairs', and inference-time addition with 'x multiplier'. The labels correspond to CAA’s described procedure without misnaming major components."

              "question": "Overall Readability",
              "score": 0.82,
              "reason": "The figure is largely easy to follow: it clearly separates (a) steering-vector construction from (b) application, uses a consistent visual flow (top-to-bottom with numbered steps), and labels key objects (contrast pair, residual stream, layer n, token position, multiplier). Readability is slightly reduced by small font sizes (especially in the prompt examples and fine labels), relatively low-contrast light gray elements that can look faint at typical paper zoom levels, and a somewhat dense left-side labeling that competes with the main flow. Overall, the core method remains legible and quickly interpretable with minor scaling/contrast improvements."

              "score": 0.95,
              "reason": "Both subfigures have a clear top-to-bottom flow: contrast pair at the top, then transformer/layer steps, then averaging/output; application diagram similarly flows from input to intervention and onward. Minor deviation comes from a few side annotations/arrows that add slight lateral movement."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "Arrows and connectors are largely non-overlapping and do not materially cross; the few branching arrows to the residual-stream token/embedding blocks are laid out cleanly. Some visual crowding around the residual-stream/tokens area creates mild perceived overlap risk but not true crossings."

              "question": "4.3. Proximity: Are functionally closely related modules physically placed near each other?",
              "score": 0.88,
              "reason": "Related elements are generally colocated: contrast prompts are grouped, layer n sits adjacent to extraction steps, and the add/multiplier operation is placed near the residual stream in (b). The residual-stream token visualization and the difference/averaging steps are slightly spread, but still clearly associated."
            },

              "question": "4.4. Alignment: Are nodes aligned neatly horizontally and vertically according to an invisible grid?",
              "score": 0.85,
              "reason": "Main blocks (layers, residual stream labels, and central flow) are well aligned vertically. However, some callouts (step text, token blocks, and operator icons) appear offset and not fully snapped to a common grid, reducing overall alignment crispness."

              "question": "4.5. Hierarchy: Do the important main components stand out in size, thickness, or position?",
              "score": 0.78,
              "reason": "Primary structure is conveyed through central placement and larger labeled regions (contrast pair, transformer/layer n). Still, the visual weight of key operations (difference, averaging, intervention) is not strongly emphasized relative to surrounding annotations; step numbering helps but hierarchy could be stronger via bolder icons/boxing."
            },

              "question": "4.6. Margin: Is there sufficient margin between elements?",
              "score": 0.8,
              "reason": "Most elements have adequate spacing, especially in (b). In (a), the residual-stream token depiction, subtraction operator, and step text are somewhat tight, and the dense annotations near the middle-right reduce breathing room."

              "question": "4.7. Consistency: Are components with similar roles represented with the same shape and color?",
              "score": 0.92,
              "reason": "Transformer/layer blocks use consistent rectangular shapes across both subfigures, and positive/negative examples are consistently color-coded (red/blue). Operator symbols and arrow styles are also consistent; minor inconsistency arises from mixed visual styles between token heatmap-like blocks and other schematic elements."

              "score": 0.55,
              "reason": "Uses concrete schematic elements (boxes for layers, arrows for flow, +/- node for addition, small colored blocks to denote token positions/activations, and A/B answer-letter tokens) to stand in for abstract operations in activation space. However, it remains largely a conventional pipeline diagram with minimal metaphorical/iconic encoding beyond standard symbols."

              "question": "5.2. Novelty: Does the generated image have a unique style that differentiates it from common templates?",
              "score": 0.35,
              "reason": "Overall styling closely matches common ML methods figures: grayscale transformer stack, arrowed dataflow, and small callouts for steps. The slight novelty comes from the contrast-pair framing (red/blue activations) and explicitly showing the A/B answer-token extraction, but the visual language is still standard and not particularly distinctive."
            },

              "question": "5.3. Adaptability: Does it apply a layout more suitable for the specific paper, breaking away from uniform design principles?",
              "score": 0.6,
              "reason": "The split into (a) vector generation and (b) vector application is well-adapted to the method narrative, and the contrastive-pair box tightly reflects the paper’s multiple-choice construction. Still, it largely adheres to uniform ‘method schematic’ conventions rather than introducing a markedly customized layout or unconventional composition."
