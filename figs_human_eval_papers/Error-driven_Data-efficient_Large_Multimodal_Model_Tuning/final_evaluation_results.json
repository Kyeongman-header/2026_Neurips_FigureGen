              "reason": "The figure covers the core pipeline components central to the method (student model + rationale, validation set, error samples, teacher mistake/skill analysis, skill-based retrieval from a supporting set, and tuning with retrieved training samples). However, it omits several major experimental/instantiation details emphasized in the paper context (multiple student/teacher model choices, multiple tasks, different tuning data scales, comparisons to baselines, and use of a specific supporting dataset like Vision-Flan), and there are no formulas/hyperparameters or training objective details shown."

              "reason": "Yes—an end-to-end operating principle is visually clear: evaluate student on validation data, collect errors, have a teacher diagnose incorrect reasoning steps and infer missing skills, retrieve skill-relevant samples from a supporting dataset, then fine-tune the student. The included concrete magnet example and the Step 1–3 flow make the mechanism understandable, though some implementation specifics (how skills are represented, how retrieval is performed, and how tuning is executed) are not fully specified."

It does not capture the broader narrative and end-to-end paper content (motivation vs. prior approaches, detailed method components beyond the high-level loop, experimental setup across datasets/tasks/scales, baseline methods, results/ablations, and key quantitative findings).

It does not introduce equations or clearly extraneous modules. Minor potential over-specificity: the internal phrasing 'Step 1/2/3' and the explicit magnet-pole example are illustrative rather than explicitly confirmed from the provided text, but they do not contradict it."

The figure also correctly emphasizes that retrieval is driven by analyzed skill gaps rather than surface similarity. Slight ambiguity: the figure shows a tight loop from retrieved training samples back to the student, but does not explicitly show that the student is re-evaluated on the validation set after tuning (an implied iteration), though this omission does not make the shown relations incorrect."

These correspond to the described teacher-student framework and retrieval from an external task-agnostic dataset (e.g., Vision-Flan). Minor label imprecision: the paper frames the teacher as a more powerful model (examples include GPT-4o-mini and LLaVA-OneVision-72B), while the figure label 'Teacher Model (e.g., LLMs)' is slightly narrower/less consistent with 'LMMs' wording in the text (though it also says LMMs elsewhere)."

However, readability is reduced by dense paragraph-style text inside boxes, small font sizes, and mixed emphasis (e.g., red highlights) that can be hard to parse at paper zoom levels. Visual hierarchy is somewhat cluttered: multiple dashed containers, repeated labels (Step 1/2/3 in several places), and a large embedded example prompt/rationale that competes with the main schematic. Overall, the core message is understandable but would benefit from shorter in-box text, larger typography, and simplifying/condensing the illustrative example."

The Supporting Set and Skill-based Retrieval are close to each other, but the training samples box is somewhat separated, and the large student-rationale text block dominates the left, reducing perceived cohesion among left-side elements."

              "reason": "Key components are emphasized via larger boxes and bold labels (Teacher Model, Skill-based Retrieval, Training Samples), and the step annotations help.

              "reason": "Modules are consistently shown as rounded/rectangular boxes with role-distinct colors (data-like boxes vs process boxes) and the dashed grouping style is used consistently. Minor inconsistency comes from mixed visual treatments (large text callout vs module boxes) and varying border styles/weights across regions."

However, it focuses on a single subroutine (iteratively appending reasoning steps and tracking option-token probability changes) and omits other major elements needed for full coverage (e.g., broader end-to-end tuning loop details, variations in student/teacher choices, experimental setup across tasks/scales, and how retrieved samples are used in fine-tuning).

The arrows and labeled stages make the flow understandable.
