      "caption": "Figure 2. Graphical depiction of AIUTA: left shows its interaction cycle with the user, and right provides an exploded view of our method. ① The agent receives an initial instruction I: “Find a c =<object category>”. ② At each timestep t, a zero-shot policy π [53], comprising a frozen object detection module [24], selects the optimal action at. ③ Upon detection, the agent performs the proposed AIUTA. Specifically, ④ the agent first obtains an initial scene description of observation Ot from a VLM. Then, a Self-Questioner module leverages an LLM to automatically generate attribute-specific questions to the VLM, acquiring more information and refining the scene description with reduced attribute-level uncertainty, producing Srefined. ⑤ The Interaction Trigger module then evaluates Srefined against the “facts” related to the target, to determine whether to terminate the navigation (if the agent believes it has located the target object ⑥), or to pose template-free, natural-language questions to a human ⑦, updating the “facts” based on the response ⑧.",

              "score": 0.78,
              "reason": "The figure captures the main system components and data flow central to the method: user instruction and fact updates, robot loop with observation and object detection, the Self-Questioner (LLM↔VLM questioning/verification and uncertainty handling), and the Interaction Trigger (alignment scoring and decision to ask/stop/continue). However, it does not explicitly include key technical details that the paper highlights as contributions, such as the specific Normalized-Entropy uncertainty estimation formulation/metric, the exact structure of the alignment score computation, and the evaluation artifacts (CoIN-Bench, simulated user, IDKVQA). Thus it covers the major modules but omits several major technical specifics and anything formula-level."

              "score": 0.86,
              "reason": "The pipeline is largely understandable standalone: instruction comes from the human, agent navigates, triggers AIUTA upon detection, Self-Questioner refines a description via LLM-driven VLM queries with uncertainty consideration, Interaction Trigger compares to accumulated target facts and decides ask/stop/continue, then updates facts from the user response. The numbered steps and block separation help. Some terms (e.g., what exactly 'facts' are, what 'alignment score' means, and how uncertainty is quantified) remain somewhat underspecified without the caption/paper, but the operational principle is still clear."

              "score": 0.42,
              "reason": "The figure summarizes the method/architecture and interaction cycle, but not the broader paper arc: it does not depict the task definition details and setting nuances (CoIN vs standard InstanceObjectNav), the benchmark/dataset construction (CoIN-Bench), the evaluation protocols (online humans vs simulated users), or the auxiliary dataset/task (IDKVQA) and comparative results. Therefore it is not a from-beginning-to-end summary; it is primarily a method figure."

              "reason": "The figure content aligns with the described AIUTA pipeline (Self-Questioner, Interaction Trigger, Target Object Facts Ft, VLM/LLM interplay, entropy-based uncertainty, ask/continue/stop decisions). It does not introduce extraneous formulas; the only potentially unclear element is the alignment score notation (s) and policy/object detector icons, but these are consistent with the caption and paper context rather than invented mechanisms."

              "score": 0.92,
              "reason": "Relations match the text: the agent runs a navigation policy with an object detector; upon detection it invokes AIUTA; Self-Questioner uses LLM to query VLM for attributes and verify them with uncertainty (normalized-entropy) to produce S_refined; Interaction Trigger compares S_refined with accumulated user-provided facts Ft, then decides to ask the user, continue, or stop, and updates facts after user responses. This is consistent with both the narrative example (Fig. 1 sketch) and the method description."

              "reason": "Major labels (AIUTA, Self-Questioner, Interaction Trigger, Target Object Facts Ft, VLM, LLM, S_refined) match the terminology used in the provided caption/context. Minor label ambiguity remains around symbols like π/policy and alignment score s, but these are still faithful to the captioned description (zero-shot policy π; alignment score)."

              "score": 0.63,
              "reason": "The figure communicates the pipeline and interaction loop clearly at a high level (distinct modules, numbered steps, left-to-right flow), but readability is reduced by dense content and small text (e.g., multiple callouts, labels, and fine-grained annotations). Visual clutter from many arrows, icons, and simultaneous pathways competes for attention, making it harder to parse quickly without zooming. Color-coding helps separate components, yet some elements feel crowded and the hierarchy of importance (main contribution vs. secondary mechanics) is not immediately obvious at normal paper viewing scale."

              "reason": "The main narrative reads left-to-right: user/agent interaction on the left, method internals on the right, with numbered steps reinforcing progression. Some local flows (e.g., within the right panel) introduce mild top-down branching that slightly weakens a single dominant direction."

While partially mitigated by curvature and dashed styling, crossings and near-overlaps remain and reduce traceability."

              "reason": "Closely related components are well clustered: Self-Questioner contains VLM/LLM; Interaction Trigger is adjacent and downstream; Target Object Facts is positioned above feeding both. The left panel groups user/robot/policy loop coherently."

              "reason": "Major blocks (Facts, Self-Questioner, Interaction Trigger) are cleanly rectangular and aligned; the two main modules are horizontally aligned. Minor elements (number badges, arrow endpoints, small icons/text callouts) show slight off-grid placement, especially near the right-side question/response labels."

              "reason": "The overarching container ('Agent-user Interaction with UncerTainty Awareness') and the three principal blocks (Facts, Self-Questioner, Interaction Trigger) dominate visually via size and colored backgrounds. Secondary components (VLM/LLM icons, steps) are clearly subordinate."

              "score": 0.7,
              "reason": "Internal padding within the right panel blocks is generally adequate, but the left interaction cycle is denser: arrows, labels, and numbered markers crowd around the robot-agent area and at the interface between panels. Some labels sit close to lines, risking legibility at smaller print sizes."

              "score": 0.82,
              "reason": "Modules are consistently shown as rounded rectangles with distinct pastel fills; LLM/VLM are consistently iconified; user/agent elements use coherent pictograms. However, multiple arrow styles (solid vs dashed, varying colors) and mixed label conventions (e.g., question/response callouts) introduce mild inconsistency in encoding interaction types."

              "score": 0.62,
              "reason": "The figure maps abstract modules (Self-Questioner, Interaction Trigger, target facts, uncertainty) into concrete blocks, arrows, and step indices, plus small icons (human silhouette, robot, VLM/LLM labels, document/text). However, most concepts are still conveyed primarily through standard flowchart semantics and textual labels rather than richer visual metaphors (e.g., uncertainty is not strongly visualized beyond the framing and naming)."

              "score": 0.43,
              "reason": "It is clean and coherent but largely follows a conventional systems-diagram/flowchart aesthetic (rounded rectangles, pastel color coding, dashed arrows, numbered steps). The split view (cycle on the left, exploded module view on the right) adds some individuality, yet the overall visual language remains close to common ML paper diagram templates."

              "score": 0.74,
              "reason": "The layout is tailored to the paper’s contribution: it combines an interaction-cycle overview with a detailed internal breakdown, uses numbering that aligns with the caption narrative, and visually distinguishes information stores vs. modules vs. user interaction. This is more adapted than a generic pipeline, though it still relies on standard design conventions rather than a radically customized visual structure."
