      "caption": "Figure 1: MMNeedle evaluation overview. Correct answers are marked with checkmark (✓), while the incorrect answers are marked with cross (×). Our evaluation setup involves the following key components: (a) Needle Sub-Image: The needle sub-image to be retrieved based on the given caption. (b) Haystack Image Inputs: The long-context visual inputs consist of M images, each stitched from N × N sub-images. (c) Text Inputs (Instructions and Caption): Detailed instructions to MLLMs, followed by a caption describing the needle, i.e., sub-image 20. See Sec. A for MMNeedle’s complete instructions. (d) LLM Outputs: The answers from different MLLMs, indicating their ability to accurately locate the needle in the haystack based on the given caption. The expected output is composed of the model’s identification of the index, row, and column of the matching sub-image. The results showcase the comparative performance of various models: GPT-4o correctly predicts the exact location of the needle; Gemini Pro 1.5 only correctly predicts the image index of the needle; other API models predict incorrect locations; open-source models often output with wrong formats.",

              "score": 0.68,
              "reason": "The figure clearly covers the core benchmark pipeline components (needle sub-image, haystack construction via stitched sub-images, text instruction+caption prompt, and model outputs with correctness) and conveys the key task setup (predict index/row/column). However, it omits many major elements discussed in the paper context: diverse settings (varying M and N, multiple needles, positive/negative samples), dataset scale details, and the full coarse-to-fine metrics suite (existence/index/exact accuracy) beyond a single illustrative example. No formulas are shown."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "Yes: the figure is self-explanatory as an overview. It depicts the input (multiple images, each subdivided), the provided caption/instructions, the required output format (index,row,column), and example predictions across models with correct/incorrect markings. A reader can infer the operating principle: retrieval/localization of a described sub-image within a long visual context."

              "score": 0.32,
              "reason": "It is an overview figure for the evaluation setup and a small slice of results, not a full-paper summary. It does not capture end-to-end paper content such as dataset construction details, full experimental matrix (context-length scaling, stitching variations, multi-needle, negative samples), quantitative result trends, hallucination analysis, comparisons across many settings, or broader conclusions."

              "score": 0.95,
              "reason": "The figure is a schematic overview consistent with the paper’s described MMNeedle setup (needle sub-image, haystack of stitched images with sub-images, text instruction+caption, and model outputs). It does not introduce extraneous formulas or novel components. Minor potential issue: the presence/format of specific example outputs (e.g., particular malformed strings from some open-source models) is illustrative and may not be verbatim from reported runs, but it is not a new methodological claim."

              "score": 0.93,
              "reason": "Relationships are correctly depicted: a caption/instruction conditions the retrieval of a target sub-image within a multi-image haystack; images are indexed; each image is partitioned into an N×N grid of sub-images; the expected response is (index, row, column); correctness marks compare model outputs to the ground-truth location. The mapping of the example caption to the highlighted needle and the shown ground-truth (image 5, sub-image 20) is coherent with the diagram. Slight ambiguity: the text mentions “each divided into 2*2 sub-images” while the output examples include columns up to 4, which could confuse the row/column indexing scheme in the illustrative snippet."

              "question": "2.3. Label Accuracy: Are the names of major components or methodologies mentioned in the paper accurately labeled?",
              "score": 0.96,
              "reason": "Panel labels (Needle Sub-Image, Haystack Image Inputs, Text Inputs, LLM Outputs) match the described components in the caption and paper context. Terminology such as “haystack,” “needle,” “image stitching,” “sub-images,” and the output format “index, row, column” aligns with the benchmark description. Minor inconsistency risk remains around indexing bug/typo in the illustrative model outputs (row/column ranges) rather than mislabeled components."

              "question": "Overall Readability",
              "score": 0.78,
              "reason": "The figure is generally easy to follow due to its clear (a–d) panel structure, consistent labeling, and strong visual cues (boxes, arrows, and green highlight) that guide the reader through the workflow. However, readability is reduced by dense small text in panels (c) and especially (d) (many model outputs, symbols, and line breaks), which becomes hard to parse at typical paper zoom levels. The mixture of long instruction text and multiple outputs increases cognitive load, and some details (e.g., many failing outputs) feel cramped relative to the available space. Overall, the main message is legible, but fine-grained text elements are borderline without zooming."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "Related components are grouped into adjacent panels and framed: image-related elements (needle and haystack) are placed on the left/middle, while text inputs and model outputs are on the right, reflecting the pipeline."

              "question": "4.4. Alignment: Are nodes aligned neatly horizontally and vertically according to an invisible grid?",
              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "Panels share consistent heights and are aligned along a common baseline; internal boxes are mostly grid-aligned. Minor misalignments occur within the haystack panel (varying sub-image sizes/spacing)."

              "score": 0.85,
              "reason": "The four main components stand out via large framed panels and bold headers. However, within panels, emphasis is sometimes split (e.g., many output lines compete for attention), and the key correct output is not typographically dominant beyond color/checkmark."

              "question": "4.6. Margin: Is there sufficient margin between elements?",
              "score": 0.8,
              "reason": "Overall spacing between the four panels is adequate, but some internal content is tight (dense output list; small gaps around text blocks), which may reduce legibility at typical paper column widths."

              "question": "4.7. Consistency: Are components with similar roles represented with the same shape and color?",
              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "Panel headers use consistent styling and rounded rectangles; green is used consistently to highlight the target (image index/caption/correct answer). Minor inconsistency: some model outputs show formatting artifacts (e.g., '\\n', '=====') that visually break uniformity."

              "score": 0.55,
              "reason": "The figure uses a clear needle-in-a-haystack metaphor concretized via panels (needle sub-image vs. haystack image inputs) and simple symbolic cues (✓/✗) to represent correctness. However, most concepts are still explained textually (instructions, outputs) rather than encoded through more distinctive visual symbols/abbreviations beyond the basic metaphor and check/cross marks."

              "score": 0.45,
              "reason": "The multi-panel schematic (a–d) with rounded boxes and captioned callouts is common in ML/NLP benchmark papers. While integrating example model outputs (including malformed ones) adds some distinctive flavor, the visual style and graphical language largely follow a standard explanatory template rather than presenting a notably unique aesthetic or visual encoding."

              "question": "5.3. Adaptability: Does it apply a layout more suitable for the specific paper, breaking away from uniform design principles?",
              "score": 0.7,
              "reason": "The layout is well-tailored to the task: it explicitly maps inputs (needle, haystack, text prompt) to outputs across models, making the evaluation protocol immediately understandable. Including stitched sub-images and the index/row/column response format reflects the benchmark’s specifics. It is still within conventional panel-based design, but the content-driven arrangement is appropriately adapted to this paper’s contribution."
