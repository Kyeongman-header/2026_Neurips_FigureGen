      "caption": "Figure 1: Evaluation Framework for Sociodemographic Persona Prompting. We construct sociodemographic persona prompts using combinations of three different role adoption formats and three strategies for demographic priming. We populate these prompts in conjunction with various sociodemographic groups and systematically evaluate them across both open- and closed-ended tasks using a broad set of bias and alignment measures.",

              "score": 0.75,
              "reason": "The figure captures the paper’s core experimental framework: (i) persona prompt construction as Role Adoption × Demographic Priming, (ii) the 3×3=9 prompt types, (iii) evaluation across 15 demographic groups and three tasks (two open, one closed), and (iv) the main evaluation metrics (stereotypical bias, semantic diversity, language switching, opinion distance). However, it does not cover other major study components implied by the paper context such as the specific LLMs evaluated, details of how metrics are operationalized/computed, dataset/question sources for the closed-ended survey task, or any key modeling/analysis steps beyond the high-level pipeline. No formulas are presented (and none are needed here), but some important experimental specifics are omitted."

              "score": 0.85,
              "reason": "The figure is largely self-explanatory: it defines the two axes of prompt variation with concrete examples, enumerates the tasks, and lists the evaluation criteria, including directional arrows indicating desirable directions. The checkmark/cross examples (e.g., Interview+Name vs Direct+Explicit) help convey the intended comparison. Some ambiguity remains without paper context—e.g., what exactly constitutes “stereotypical bias,” how “semantic diversity” is measured, and what “opinion distance” is computed against—so a reader can grasp the operating principle but not the exact methodology."

              "reason": "This is a framework/overview figure rather than a full-paper summary. It does not include major end-to-end elements such as research questions, hypotheses, model lineup, experimental controls, main findings (e.g., which strategies work best, group disparities, model-size result), statistical analysis, limitations, or implications/guidelines. It summarizes the study design slice (prompt taxonomy + evaluation setup) but not the paper ‘from beginning to end.’"

              "score": 0.95,
              "reason": "The figure content matches the described framework: 9 prompt types as Role Adoption (Direct/Third Person/Interview) × Demographic Priming (Explicit/Structured/Name), evaluated on 15 groups and 3 tasks, with metrics (stereotypical bias, semantic diversity, language switching, opinion distance). No extra formulas or unrelated components are introduced. Minor risk: the checkmark/cross illustrative comparison (e.g., 'Interview+Name' vs 'Direct+Explicit') is a presentation device not explicitly described as a specific experimental contrast, but it does not add new methodological components."

              "score": 0.92,
              "reason": "Relationships are correctly depicted: prompts are constructed by combining role-adoption formats with demographic-priming strategies, then populated with demographic groups and evaluated across open- and closed-ended tasks using the listed measures. The mapping of measures to task type (open: stereotypical bias/semantic diversity/language switching; closed: opinion distance) aligns with the caption and context. Slight ambiguity: the figure implies 'Interview+Name' generally yields low bias/high diversity/low switching and 'Direct+Explicit' the opposite; the paper describes these as observed tendencies, but the figure’s categorical icons can read as universally true rather than empirical trends."

              "reason": "Key labels match the paper’s terminology: 'Sociodemographic Persona Prompts', 'Role Adoption' (Direct/Third Person/Interview), 'Demographic Priming' (Explicit/Structured/Name), task labels (Self-Description, Social Media Bio, Survey Response), and evaluation measures (Stereotypical Bias, Semantic Diversity, Language Switching, Opinion Distance).

              "score": 0.83,
              "reason": "The figure clearly abstracts the paper’s core framework into two axes (Role Adoption × Demographic Priming) and connects them to tasks and evaluation metrics. It prioritizes the conceptual structure over procedural minutiae. Minor readability drag comes from having several textual items and examples in one panel, which slightly competes with the main schema."

              "score": 0.88,
              "reason": "As a companion to the caption/text, it provides a quick mental model of the experimental design (prompt types → tasks → measures) and includes concrete prompt examples that anchor terminology. The mapping from open/closed tasks to metrics is understandable without extensive cross-referencing, though the small text size may limit utility when printed or viewed at reduced scale."

              "score": 0.76,
              "reason": "Most elements serve the explanatory goal (categorization, examples, tasks, and evaluation criteria). However, some redundancy/extra visual load appears in repeated headings and multiple example blocks plus iconography (checkmarks/crosses) that could be simplified; these additions slightly increase clutter without adding proportional explanatory value."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "The layout reads cleanly top-to-bottom: title/definition at top, prompt-type breakdown in the middle, task list below, and evaluation outcomes at the bottom. The implied pipeline is clear without needing arrows."

              "reason": "Role Adoption and Demographic Priming are grouped together under the prompt-types section, and open/closed tasks are grouped with their example questions. The evaluation metrics and example prompt combinations are co-located in the evaluation panel; overall proximity matches semantics well."

              "score": 0.85,
              "reason": "Most text blocks and section headers align consistently, and the two-column structures (e.g., Open vs Closed; example prompt types on the right) are fairly grid-like. Minor alignment inconsistencies appear in the right-hand lists and the check/cross columns in the evaluation panel."

              "reason": "Section headers ('Sociodemographic Persona Prompts', 'Evaluation', 'Role Adoption', 'Demographic Priming', 'Open Tasks', 'Closed Task') are visually prominent via size, weight, and color, giving clear hierarchy and scan order."

              "score": 0.8,
              "reason": "Within sections, spacing is generally adequate, but the figure is information-dense and some blocks (especially the task descriptions and the evaluation rows) feel tight, reducing breathing room and potentially affecting readability at smaller print sizes."
            },

              "question": "4.7. Consistency: Are components with similar roles represented with the same shape and color?",
              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "Color is used consistently to encode categories (orange for prompt construction dimensions, green/blue for open/closed tasks). Iconography in the evaluation panel (check vs cross) is consistent. Minor inconsistency comes from some items being styled as plain text lists while others are emphasized, but overall encoding is coherent."

              "score": 0.62,
              "reason": "The figure uses concrete visual cues (section icons, check/cross marks, arrows for increase/decrease, concise labels like Direct/Third Person/Interview, Explicit/Structured/Name) to stand in for abstract methodological dimensions and evaluation outcomes. However, the metaphoric/ikonographic layer is fairly conventional and text-heavy; the abstractions are still primarily explained verbally rather than being conveyed through stronger symbolic encoding."

              "score": 0.48,
              "reason": "The design is clean and coherent but resembles common \"framework overview\" templates: stacked sections, bold headings, color-coded categories, and simple outcome indicators. The combination of persona-prompt taxonomy + task/evaluation summary is specific to the paper, yet the visual style and devices are standard and not especially distinctive."

              "score": 0.66,
              "reason": "The layout is tailored to the paper’s conceptual structure (2D prompt design space, mapped to tasks and metrics, plus illustrative examples contrasting prompt combinations). This reflects the study’s factorial setup and evaluation pipeline more directly than a generic diagram would. Still, it largely follows conventional modular infographic structure rather than introducing a notably customized or unconventional visual grammar."
