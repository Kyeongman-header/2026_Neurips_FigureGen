  "caption": "Figure 1: The example contains an ambiguous context; thus, the correct answer is \"can’t answer\" since it is impossible to judge which group corresponds to the answer for a given negative question (e.g., \"What group of people uses drugs?\"). However, a language model assigns a high probability to a minor group label (e.g., \"poor people\"). Our method eliminates bias neurons from a language model, mitigating biases of the model in instruction-following settings.",
