  "caption": "Figure 1: The illustration of the LUQ and LUQ-ENSEMBLE framework. Given a question, various LLMs exhibit differing levels of uncertainty. We generate n sample responses from each LLM and then assess the uncertainty based on the diversity of these samples (the LUQ metric). Green highlights indicate consistency across responses (low uncertainty) and red highlights discrepancies (high uncertainty). The LUQ-ENSEMBLE method selects the response from the LLM with the lowest uncertainty score as the final answer.",
