      "caption": "Figure 1: The illustration of the LUQ and LUQ-ENSEMBLE framework. Given a question, various LLMs exhibit differing levels of uncertainty. We generate n sample responses from each LLM and then assess the uncertainty based on the diversity of these samples (the LUQ metric). Green highlights indicate consistency across responses (low uncertainty) and red highlights discrepancies (high uncertainty). The LUQ-ENSEMBLE method selects the response from the LLM with the lowest uncertainty score as the final answer.",

              "score": 0.55,
              "reason": "The figure covers the core pipeline elements (question → multiple LLMs → n sampled responses → consistency/diversity-based uncertainty scoring → LUQ-ENSEMBLE selecting lowest-uncertainty answer) and conveys the key intuition (green=consistent, red=discrepant). However, it omits major technical specifics described in the paper such as the exact LUQ definitions (e.g., LUQ-ATOMIC vs LUQ-PAIR mechanisms), any explicit uncertainty/diversity formula, how sentence-level consistency is computed/aggregated, and how factuality correlation/FactScore is operationalized. It also does not include the background entropy/confidence equations or clarify how LUQ relates to them."

              "score": 0.82,
              "reason": "Yes, at a high level: it clearly shows generating multiple samples per model, checking whether specific claims are supported across samples, deriving an uncertainty score from agreement, and picking the model/answer with lowest uncertainty (ensemble). The color-coding and left-to-right layout make the qualitative principle understandable. What remains unclear standalone is the precise computation (what is being compared, what constitutes “support,” how scores like 0.545 are derived, and what n is), but the operating principle is largely conveyed."

              "score": 0.3,
              "reason": "No. The figure is an illustrative overview of the LUQ/LUQ-ENSEMBLE framework and does not summarize the paper end-to-end. It does not represent the broader narrative: limitations of prior UQ for long text, the two LUQ variants (ATOMIC/PAIR), datasets (FACTSCORE and FACTSCORE-DIS), experimental setup across multiple LLMs, correlation results, selective answering strategy, or key quantitative findings. It functions as a method schematic rather than a full-paper summary."

              "score": 0.92,
              "reason": "The figure sticks to elements described in the paper context: LUQ as sampling-based uncertainty from diversity/consistency across multiple sampled long-form responses, sentence/claim-level support checks, and LUQ-ENSEMBLE selecting the lowest-uncertainty model output. No extra mathematical formulas or unrelated modules are introduced. Minor risk: the exact numeric uncertainty values and the explicit “Yes/No probability” support-check interface may be illustrative rather than verbatim from the method description, but they do not introduce new methodology beyond what LUQ implies."

              "score": 0.86,
              "reason": "Core relationships are consistent: (1) generate n samples per LLM, (2) compute uncertainty from cross-sample consistency/diversity at the sentence/claim level, (3) lower uncertainty corresponds to higher factuality (paper reports strong negative correlation), and (4) LUQ-ENSEMBLE selects the response from the model with lowest uncertainty. Slight ambiguity: the figure suggests uncertainty is computed via claim support probabilities (Yes/No) per sample, which is plausible but may overspecify the exact computation compared with the paper’s broader “sentence-level consistency” framing."

              "score": 0.95,
              "reason": "Major labels match the paper: LUQ, LUQ-ENSEMBLE, sampling of multiple responses, uncertainty calculation, and selecting the lowest-uncertainty response. The depiction of multiple LLMs with different uncertainties aligns with the stated ensemble setup. No evident misnaming of components; minor note that the figure does not explicitly distinguish LUQ-ATOMIC vs LUQ-PAIR, but it also does not mislabel them."

              "score": 0.78,
              "reason": "The figure captures the core pipeline (question → multiple LLMs → sampled responses → consistency-based uncertainty → ensemble select-lowest-uncertainty) and visually maps “consistency vs. discrepancy” to uncertainty, which aligns with the main contribution. However, it includes fairly specific example content (named entity details, dates, tomb IDs, discoverers) that is longer than needed to convey the mechanism, slightly diluting the schematic focus."

              "score": 0.86,
              "reason": "As a supplement, it effectively operationalizes the caption: it shows multiple models with different uncertainty values, the sampling procedure, and how sentence-level support decisions aggregate into an uncertainty score and then into ensemble selection. The left-to-right structure supports reading flow. Minor readability friction comes from dense text blocks and small font sizes that may be hard to parse when embedded in a paper column."

              "score": 0.72,
              "reason": "Some decorative UI icons and chat-style containers add visual appeal but do not materially advance the method explanation. Repetition of multiple near-identical sample paragraphs and multiple uncertainty labels (plus ellipses) increases clutter. Still, most elements are at least loosely tied to the central idea (variation across samples/models), so redundancy is moderate rather than severe."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "The layout clearly reads left-to-right: User/query and model answers on the left, sample responses in the center, and uncertainty calculation on the right, reinforced by connecting arrows/curves and a final downward arrow to the output uncertainty."

              "reason": "Connection lines are mostly non-overlapping: a single main curved connector from left to center and another to the right; minimal visual crossings, though the curved bracket-like links add some visual complexity near the left stack."

              "reason": "Related items are grouped well: user prompt and LLM answers are co-located, sampled responses are grouped in the center, and the support-check/Q&A computations are grouped in a dedicated panel on the right."

              "reason": "Major columns (left/center/right) are well structured, and items within panels are generally aligned; however, some elements (icons, uncertainty badges, and curved connectors) do not consistently snap to a strict grid, giving slight unevenness."

              "score": 0.85,
              "reason": "Primary stages are emphasized via three large labeled panels and columnar placement; the final uncertainty output is also visually separated. Some secondary details (highlighted text snippets and multiple uncertainty badges) compete slightly with the main-stage emphasis."

              "score": 0.8,
              "reason": "Panels and internal boxes have reasonable padding, and there is whitespace between the three main modules. Still, text within the sample-response boxes and the right calculation panel feels dense, and the left stack is relatively tight vertically."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "Consistent visual language: sample responses use similar rounded rectangles; uncertainty badges share a common style; green/red highlighting is used consistently for agreement/disagreement; icons and headers are stylistically coherent across sections."

              "score": 0.72,
              "reason": "The figure concretizes the pipeline with recognizable icons (user, LLM agents, calculator), color-coded evidence (green/red highlights for consistency vs. discrepancy), and boxed stages. These choices effectively translate “uncertainty from sample diversity” into an intuitive visual metaphor. However, the metaphor remains fairly literal (a standard flow/process depiction) and relies heavily on text excerpts rather than more symbolic representations of uncertainty/diversity."

              "score": 0.48,
              "reason": "While the use of chat-style icons, colored highlights over sample responses, and an uncertainty readout is polished, the overall look aligns with common ML/NLP system-diagram conventions (three-panel pipeline, callouts, arrows, rounded rectangles). The stylistic elements feel familiar rather than distinctly novel."

              "question": "5.3. Adaptability: Does it apply a layout more suitable for the specific paper, breaking away from uniform design principles?",
              "score": 0.66,
              "reason": "The layout is well-adapted to LUQ: it juxtaposes multiple LLM outputs, shows multiple sampled responses, and then links to per-claim support checks and an aggregated uncertainty score—matching the method’s logic. The inclusion of highlighted spans directly supports the long-text consistency idea. Still, the organization remains a conventional left-to-right pipeline rather than a substantially unconventional or paper-specific visual structure."
