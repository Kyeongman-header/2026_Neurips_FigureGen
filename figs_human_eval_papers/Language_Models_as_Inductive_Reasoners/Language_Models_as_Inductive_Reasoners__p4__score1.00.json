Rule Proposer is a generative model based on input facts and desired rule template, aiming at generating (a large number of) rule candidates. Deductive consistency evaluator, indiscriminate confirmation handler, generalization checker, and triviality detector are classification models that filter improper rules according to four requirements of the induced rules in inductive reasoning. Texts with ✗ are representative filtered rules for each module.",
