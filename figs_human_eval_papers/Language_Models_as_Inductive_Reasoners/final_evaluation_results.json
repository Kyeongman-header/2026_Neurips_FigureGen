Rule Proposer is a generative model based on input facts and desired rule template, aiming at generating (a large number of) rule candidates. Deductive consistency evaluator, indiscriminate confirmation handler, generalization checker, and triviality detector are classification models that filter improper rules according to four requirements of the induced rules in inductive reasoning. Texts with ✗ are representative filtered rules for each module.",

              "reason": "The figure covers the core CoLM pipeline components (Rule Proposer M1 plus four filtering/classification modules M2–M5) and names the four induction requirements (deductive consistency, indiscriminate confirmation, generalization, triviality) with example rejected rules. However, it omits other major paper elements such as the DEER dataset specification (size, construction, domains), rule-template mapping details, evaluation metrics (automatic and human), experimental settings/models, and results; no formulas beyond module labels (P_Mi) are conveyed."

              "reason": "A reader can infer the operational principle: generate many rule candidates from facts and then sequentially filter them with specialized checkers to keep acceptable inductive rules. The left-to-right flow and captions help. Still, some notions are not self-explained (what exactly counts as each requirement, what the P_Mi scores mean, how templates constrain generation, whether modules are applied sequentially vs. independently, and what the final output represents), limiting full standalone understanding."

It does not include the task definition details, dataset creation and statistics, rule templates, proposed evaluation metrics, experimental comparisons/baselines, quantitative findings, error analysis, or conclusions/future work, so it is far from a complete paper summary."

              "reason": "The figure matches the described CoLM framework: five modules (Rule Proposer M1; four classifier-based filters M2–M5) and the four stated requirements (deductive consistency, indiscriminate confirmation, generalization, triviality). The example filtered rules and the flow from facts→rules→filtered rules are consistent with the caption. Minor potential over-specificity: the per-module probability notations (e.g., p_M2(fact|rule), p_M3(rule), p_M4(fact|rule), p_M5(rule)) are not justified by the provided text excerpt alone, so they could be seen as extra formalism unless explicitly defined elsewhere in the paper."

              "score": 0.93,
              "reason": "Relationships are represented correctly: M1 generates many candidate rules conditioned on facts and a rule template; M2–M5 act as successive filters to remove improper rules according to the four induction requirements, yielding remaining rules. This aligns with the caption’s description of ‘classification models that filter improper rules’. One minor ambiguity is whether the modules are strictly sequential as drawn (pipeline) versus potentially applied in another orchestration; the figure asserts a pipeline ordering that may or may not be exactly how the method is implemented, but the caption implies filtering, which supports the pipeline depiction."

              "reason": "The pipeline depiction (Rule Proposer → four filtering/checking modules → final rule) captures the paper’s core contribution (CoLM) at a high level and labels each component by its inductive-reasoning role. Minor readability drag comes from small, dense inline example text under each module (including probability notation and crossed-out examples), which adds detail that is not strictly necessary for the schematic overview."
