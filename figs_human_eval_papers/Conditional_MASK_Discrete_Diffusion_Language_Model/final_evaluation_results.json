However, the actual operating principle—how the integration is done (iterative token updates, entropy-based selection/scheduling, denoising procedure)—is not explained, so understanding remains conceptual rather than procedural."

However, the paper’s specific integration mechanism (cMRF/D-cMRF framing, EAGS/ENS details) is not represented; the figure suggests a direct “MLM + Diffusion = Diffusion-EAGS” merge without indicating the conditional MRF lens or entropy-adaptive procedures that are central to how the combination is achieved."

Minor formatting/typography issue in the caption (“DiffusionEAGS” vs “Diffusion-EAGS”) and the figure does not name the two key methodologies (EAGS, ENS) or the cMRF/D-cMRF terminology mentioned in the text."

However, readability is reduced by (i) small text in several boxes (e.g., inner labels) that may become hard to read at typical paper zoom levels, (ii) visual clutter from multiple emoji/icons and repeated sentiment faces that do not add informational content, (iii) somewhat busy layout with several dashed containers and arrows converging on a plus sign, which slightly increases cognitive load, and (iv) caption text/terms (e.g., “DiffusionEAGS”, “diffusionbased”) appearing cramped/inconsistently hyphenated compared to the paper’s typography.
