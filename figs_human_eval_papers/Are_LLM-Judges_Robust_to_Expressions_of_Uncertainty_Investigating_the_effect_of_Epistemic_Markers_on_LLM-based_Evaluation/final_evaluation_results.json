              "score": 0.55,
              "reason": "The figure clearly defines the key robustness metric used in the paper section it comes from—Verdict Switch Rate (VSR) and its decomposition into I2C and C2I, with a simple schematic showing how verdicts change with epistemic markers. However, it does not cover other major elements described in the paper context (e.g., EMBERQA vs. EMBERIF task setups, epistemic marker types such as weakeners/strengtheners, dataset construction, or experimental comparisons across models). Thus it is informative about the metric but not about the overall methodology."

              "reason": "As a standalone, it communicates the operating principle of the evaluation metric well: measure how often an LLM-judge’s verdict flips when epistemic markers are introduced, and sum flips in both directions (I2C and C2I). The diagram and labels make the notion of “verdict switching due to markers” easy to grasp, though details like how verdicts are obtained (single vs pairwise judging) and what counts as markers are not explained in the figure."

              "reason": "No. The figure is narrowly focused on one metric definition and does not summarize the paper end-to-end (benchmark design, tasks, marker distributions, main findings about bias patterns, human vs LLM judge comparisons, or real-life implications)."

              "score": 0.95,
              "reason": "The figure contains only the elements needed to define verdict transitions (Correct/Incorrect under no markers vs with markers), the two transition types (C2I, I2C), and the derived metric VSR = I2C + C2I. These components align with the caption’s description of robustness metrics and do not introduce extra, unmotivated formulas or entities."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "The relationships are coherent: epistemic markers can cause verdicts to switch between Correct and Incorrect; C2I and I2C represent directional switch rates; VSR as the sum of these two rates correctly represents an overall switch rate. The diagram’s arrows and the equation match this intended definition."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "Labels C2I and I2C are clearly defined in-figure as percentages of changed verdicts in the corresponding directions, and VSR is explicitly labeled and defined as their sum. The states 'CORRECT (LLM = Human)' and 'INCORRECT (LLM ≠ Human)' are consistent with framing correctness as agreement with a human/reference verdict in a robustness setting."

              "score": 0.78,
              "reason": "The diagram is a compact schematic of the key evaluation outcome categories (Correct/Incorrect relative to human) and the two switch directions (I2C, C2I), directly culminating in the main metric (VSR = I2C + C2I). It largely avoids task-specific minutiae. Minor readability drag comes from repeated box text and the need to interpret abbreviations (C2I/I2C) without much visual hierarchy."

              "score": 0.83,
              "reason": "Given the caption, the figure supports comprehension by visually mapping how epistemic markers cause verdict transitions and how those transitions aggregate into VSR. The left-to-right flow aligns with the narrative of “before vs. after adding markers.” However, understanding depends on knowing what condition changes between the two sides (with vs. without markers); this is implied by the caption/text but not explicit within the figure itself."

              "score": 0.74,
              "reason": "The content is mostly essential, but there are some mildly redundant/ornamental choices: duplicated 'CORRECT/INCORRECT (LLM =/≠ Human)' labels on both sides, dashed rounded frames, and multiple arrow styles. These do not add much semantic information beyond the core transition concept and can slightly clutter the visual, though they are not excessive."

              "score": 0.95,
              "reason": "The layout clearly reads left-to-right: initial verdict states on the left map via arrows to post-marker verdict states on the right. Arrowheads and the VSR definition reinforce this flow."

              "reason": "The main components (the four verdict states) are prominent, but the key metric (VSR) is comparatively small and placed below/right, making it somewhat secondary despite being central to interpretation."

              "score": 0.35,
              "reason": "The figure uses abbreviated labels (C2I, I2C) and directional arrows to concretize transitions between verdict states, which partially substitutes abstract robustness effects with simple symbolic flow. However, it relies on standard boxes-and-arrows rather than richer metaphorical/iconic elements, so the metaphor layer is limited."

              "reason": "The visual design is largely conventional (two panels of rounded rectangles, arrows, dashed outlines). The red-highlighted cross-arrows add emphasis but do not substantially depart from common schematic templates used in ML/NLP papers."

              "score": 0.45,
              "reason": "The layout is tailored to the paper’s specific metric definition by explicitly mapping the two switch types (C2I and I2C) onto a state-transition diagram and tying them to VSR. While still using a standard schematic form, the arrangement effectively matches the metric’s semantics rather than adopting a generic chart, showing moderate adaptability."
