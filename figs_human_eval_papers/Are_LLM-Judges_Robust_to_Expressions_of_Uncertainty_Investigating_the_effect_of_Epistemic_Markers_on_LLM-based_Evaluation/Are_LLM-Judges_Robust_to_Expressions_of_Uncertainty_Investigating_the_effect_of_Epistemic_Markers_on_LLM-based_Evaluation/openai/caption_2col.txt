Figure 1. Overview of EMBER, a meta-evaluation benchmark testing whether LLM-judges’ correctness verdicts remain stable when candidate outputs are augmented with epistemic markers (strengtheners, weakeners, or none). Results across five judges show systematic bias against markers, strongest for weakeners, and reduced sensitivity with larger models.
