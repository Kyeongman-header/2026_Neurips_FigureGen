              "score": 0.6,
              "reason": "The figure covers the core architectural components central to the paper’s contribution: LLM backbone (token embedding + decoder layers), a multi-objective regression head producing interpretable dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, verbosity), and a gating layer producing coefficients to scalarize into a final score. However, it omits other major elements typically discussed in the paper such as training objectives/loss formulations, the two-stage training procedure details, how absolute-rating data is used, the MoE/mixture interpretation beyond a single gating module, and any benchmark/evaluation setup; thus it is not comprehensive for 'all major components or formulas'."

              "score": 0.85,
              "reason": "The diagram communicates a clear end-to-end flow: prompt+response tokens are encoded by an LLM, a regression layer outputs multiple objective scores, and a gating layer assigns weights (including possibly negative) to combine them into one scalar reward. Even without the paper, a reader can infer multi-objective scoring plus context-dependent weighting to yield a final reward. Minor ambiguities remain (e.g., how the gating depends on the prompt/response, whether coefficients are constrained/normalized, and how objectives are defined/learned), but the operating principle is largely understandable."

              "reason": "This figure is primarily an architecture schematic and does not summarize the full paper arc (motivation, data collection/labeling with absolute ratings, two-stage training pipeline, experimental protocol, RewardBench results, comparisons to GPT-4-judge/Nemotron, ablations, or conclusions/limitations). It captures the model structure but not the broader methodology and findings from start to finish."

              "reason": "The figure shows an LLM backbone (token embedding + decoder layers), a regression layer producing multi-objective rewards (helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, verbosity), and a gating layer producing coefficients to scalarize to a final score—matching the described architecture. The only potentially speculative detail is the concrete example coefficients (e.g., 0.8×, 0.6×, -0.2×), which appear illustrative rather than a claimed fixed setting."

              "score": 0.93,
              "reason": "Relationships are depicted correctly: prompt/response tokens go through the ArmoRM backbone; the regression head outputs per-objective scores; the gating layer produces context-dependent weights used to combine objectives into a scalar reward. One minor ambiguity is whether the gating network takes inputs from the backbone hidden states vs. objectives/prompt alone; the paper summary says a shallow MLP “on top of the ArmoRM,” which the figure conveys but not with precise input specification."

              "score": 0.98,
              "reason": "Key labels align with the paper: ArmoRM, regression layer for multi-objective reward modeling, gating layer for scalarization, and the example objective dimensions (helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, verbosity). Component naming is consistent with standard LLM terminology (token embedding, decoder layers)."

              "score": 0.83,
              "reason": "The diagram foregrounds the key conceptual pipeline—LLM backbone (ArmoRM) → multi-objective regression heads → gating layer producing coefficients → scalar score—directly reflecting the paper’s main contribution (interpretable multi-objective reward + context-dependent scalarization). It omits algorithmic/training details appropriately. Minor distraction comes from showing multiple decoder blocks and token icons, which add a bit of implementation-flavor rather than purely conceptual emphasis."

              "score": 0.87,
              "reason": "Given the caption, the mapping between components is clear: inputs (prompt/response tokens) flow into ArmoRM, the regression layer yields objective-wise scores, and the gating layer outputs weights to combine them into a final score. The objectives listed (helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, verbosity) anchor the interpretability claim and match the surrounding text. A small readability gap is that the gating layer’s input (what context it conditions on) is not explicitly indicated, which could slightly reduce explanatory completeness."

              "score": 0.74,
              "reason": "Most visual elements are functional, but there is some decorative/low-information styling: large colored blocks, multiple token glyphs, checkmark/X icons, and explicit numeric weights (0.8×, 0.6×, 0×, -0.2×) that are illustrative rather than necessary. The repeated 'Decoder Layer' blocks and ellipsis also add visual mass without adding conceptual distinctions. These do not severely harm comprehension but slightly reduce overall schematic economy."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "Overall flow is clearly left-to-right: prompt/response tokens enter ArmoRM on the left, objectives/weights are produced toward the right, culminating in a final score. Minor ambiguity arises from the gating layer sitting above and feeding rightward, which slightly disrupts a single straight flow."

              "score": 0.75,
              "reason": "Most connections are non-crossing and well separated, but the magenta gating connection and the red score arrow create a visually busy region on the right; the gating line routing can be perceived as partially overlapping/crossing with other right-side arrows (even if not strictly intersecting)."

              "score": 0.85,
              "reason": "Core ArmoRM components (embedding/decoder/regression) are grouped, and the objective list is adjacent to the weighting/output area. The gating layer is close to the objectives/weights it controls, though its placement above (rather than integrated beside the scalarization block) slightly weakens perceived tight coupling."

              "score": 0.8,
              "reason": "Major blocks are cleanly aligned in columns (ArmoRM block, objective list, weights/output). Some smaller elements (token icons, small circles, and right-side checkboxes/coefficients) feel less grid-aligned and vary in spacing, reducing overall neatness."

              "question": "4.5. Hierarchy: Do the important main components stand out in size, thickness, or position?",
              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "ArmoRM is emphasized with a large shaded container; the gating layer is visually distinct (bright magenta) and the final score is highlighted in red. The hierarchy between backbone/regression/objectives is readable and guides attention appropriately."

              "question": "4.6. Margin: Is there sufficient margin between elements?",
              "score": 0.7,
              "reason": "Left and central regions have comfortable whitespace, but the right side (objective list, checkbox/weight column, and outgoing 'Score' arrow) is relatively cramped, making that area feel dense and slightly harder to parse at a glance."

              "score": 0.8,
              "reason": "Network modules use consistent block shapes, and the token icons are consistently styled. However, the mix of iconography (checkboxes, X mark, numeric coefficients, colored arrows) introduces stylistic heterogeneity, and the objective indicators (green/orange circles) are not fully explained visually, slightly weakening consistency."

              "score": 0.62,
              "reason": "The figure uses concrete UI-like metaphors (tokens as small squares, checkmarks/crosses for selected objectives, and numeric coefficients like 0.8×) to make the abstract notion of multi-objective scalarization and gating more tangible. However, most components remain standard block-diagram abstractions (LLM backbone/decoder/regression/gating), so metaphorical/iconic substitution is partial rather than pervasive."

              "score": 0.48,
              "reason": "Stylistically, it largely follows a familiar ML architecture schematic: colored modules, arrows, and a rightward pipeline. The use of a checklist panel with weights and a large red 'Score' label adds some distinctive flair, but overall it still resembles common deep-learning diagram templates rather than presenting a markedly unique visual language."

              "question": "5.3. Adaptability: Does it apply a layout more suitable for the specific paper, breaking away from uniform design principles?",
              "score": 0.71,
              "reason": "The layout is tailored to the paper’s core contribution—explicitly separating multi-objective heads from the gating scalarization step and visualizing objective selection/weighting. The prompt/response token distinction and the objective-weight panel are adapted to interpretability and MoE-gating claims. While still a left-to-right pipeline, it meaningfully departs from a generic 'encoder→heads' diagram by foregrounding the interpretable objective mixture mechanism."
