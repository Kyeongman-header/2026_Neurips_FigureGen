However, it omits several major aspects discussed in the paper’s framework/experiments (e.g., construction procedure of CC datasets, controls like input order/context length, retrieval/generation top-k details, and the analysis factors such as similarity gap and semantic completeness/segmentation).

Components shown (question q, retrieved context d^γ, generated context d^ϱ, reader ϕ, answers a^γ_ϕ / a^ϱ_ϕ, and an EM-based decision) are consistent with the paper’s framing of attributing outputs to one context source. Minor risk: the explicit depiction of an \"EM\" block and the equivalence-style decision (a_ϕ = a^γ_ϕ or a_ϕ = a^ϱ_ϕ) may be a graphical simplification; if the paper does not explicitly introduce EM as the exact mechanism (vs using EM as an evaluation metric), this could be interpreted as adding an unclarified procedural component."

Showing two candidate answers supported by different contexts correctly reflects the attribution idea. However, the diagram suggests a hard either/or outcome (output equals one of the two source-specific answers) selected via EM, which may overstate determinism—LLMs can blend evidence; the paper’s core claim is that they bias toward generated context, not necessarily that outputs are always exactly one of the two source-derived answers."

The use of γ/ϱ/ϕ notation is consistent with the paper’s background section. The only potential ambiguity is labeling \"EM\" without clarifying it as Exact Match (a metric) rather than an algorithmic module; if the paper uses EM strictly as an evaluation score, depicting it as a processing block could be slightly misleading."

It also shows the key actors (retriever, generator, reader, corpus) and the three-step procedure referenced in the text. However, it does not include many other major elements discussed in the paper such as evaluation setup/results across multiple LLMs and datasets, quantified bias metrics, analyses of similarity/completeness factors, or any formal notation beyond light tuple/formula-like snippets—so coverage is strong for dataset construction but incomplete for the paper’s full technical and experimental scope."

The stepwise layout (Context Preparation → Sample Filtering/Traceability → Building Dataset/Exclusivity) and explicit roles (retriever/generator/reader) make the operating principle clear: create conflicting retrieved vs. generated contexts, test which context the reader’s answer aligns with, and filter to ensure only one context supports the correct answer. The inclusion of example question/contexts and a dataset-output box improves self-containment.

It uses standard symbols consistent with the paper’s notation (q, retrieved/generated contexts, reader output). No clear extra modules or unexplained formulas appear beyond what the paper describes. Minor risk: the exact labels 'AIR'/'AIG' and the specific set/tuple notation in the final dataset box could be slightly more specific than shown elsewhere, but they are consistent with the described split into retrieved-correct vs generated-correct cases."

This matches the paper’s intent of constructing conflicting pairs and controlling confounds.

However, it omits many major elements that are central to the paper’s study design and analysis (e.g., the systematic attribution framework, the context-conflicting dataset construction, controls like input order/length, and factors like similarity and segmentation/completeness), and it does not include the formal notation (e.g., γ, ϱ, ϕ; D_k^γ, D_k^ϱ; a_ϕ) discussed in the text."

              "reason": "Yes for the broad operating principle: the three subfigures make it easy to infer that retrieval selects passages from a corpus, generation produces synthetic background context, and a hybrid approach feeds both into a reader to answer. The flow arrows and labeling make the roles of retriever/generator/reader interpretable without additional context. What is not fully intelligible standalone is the paper’s key issue (conflicting contexts and bias toward generated contexts) and the experimental/attribution methodology—those are not conveyed explicitly in this figure."

              "reason": "No. This figure is a background/framework schematic rather than an end-to-end summary of the paper. It does not capture the paper’s main empirical finding (hybrid degradation and bias toward generated contexts), the dataset/framework for conflicting contexts, the evaluation setup across models, or the explanatory analyses (question-context similarity, semantic completeness/segmentation effects, and dismissal of confirmation bias). Thus, it does not summarize the paper from start to finish."

Labels are generally clear and the left-to-right layout supports quick parsing. Minor readability friction comes from small font in the question/context boxes and relatively dense text inside the context rectangles, which may be harder to read at typical paper zoom levels."

However, repeated long example sentences within the context boxes and the red answer tokens (e.g., “skeleton”, “cross-country skiing”) add some redundancy; the same point could be conveyed with shorter placeholders (e.g., 'retrieved passage', 'generated passage', 'answer').
