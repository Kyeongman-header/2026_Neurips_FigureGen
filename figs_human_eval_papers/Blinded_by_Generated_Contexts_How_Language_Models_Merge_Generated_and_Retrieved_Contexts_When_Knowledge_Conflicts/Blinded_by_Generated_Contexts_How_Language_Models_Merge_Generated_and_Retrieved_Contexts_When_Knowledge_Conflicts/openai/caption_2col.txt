Hybrid question answering with retrieved and LLM-generated contexts: retrieval-augmented, generation-augmented, and hybrid pipelines, plus the answer-tracing setup and context-conflicting (CC) dataset construction. Results highlight systematic preference for generated contexts, quantified by DiffGR.
