              "reason": "The figure captures the paper’s two core proposed components (RIND for when-to-retrieve and QFS for what-to-retrieve) and shows an end-to-end dynamic RAG loop with retrieval triggering, query construction, and continuation with external knowledge. It also provides a compact baseline comparison (SR-RAG/FL-RAG/FS-RAG/FLARE/DRAGIN) along the same two axes. However, it omits many major elements typically needed for full method coverage: the precise definitions/derivations of the RIND score (beyond a suggestive H_i, amax(i), s_i visualization), thresholds/decision rules in detail, algorithmic steps, retrieval setup/corpus, evaluation metrics/datasets, and ablations—so it is not comprehensive with respect to all major content in the paper."

              "reason": "Yes at a high level: it visually explains that the LLM generates, RIND detects real-time information need and decides whether to retrieve, QFS forms a query using self-attention over the context, retrieved knowledge is appended/used, and the LLM continues generation. The baseline table clarifies how DRAGIN differs from static or heuristic triggering/querying strategies.

This mismatch suggests the figure content is not faithfully aligned to what is being presented/claimed. Additionally, several symbols/formulas shown in the diagram (e.g., H_i, amax(i), s_i, S_RIND, and the explicit conditions “Any S_RIND > θ / All S_RIND < θ”) are not supported by the provided paper context excerpt, so they cannot be verified as present in the paper from the given material."

              "reason": "At a high level, the depicted relationships match the described framework: RIND decides when to retrieve, and QFS crafts the query using self-attention over the context, after which retrieved knowledge conditions continued generation. However, the specific operational relations implied by the diagram (token-level scoring leading to a single trigger via thresholding, and the exact query composition) are not confirmable from the provided excerpt, so only the coarse relationship can be judged as likely correct."

Baseline names shown in the comparison (e.g., SR-RAG, FL-RAG, FS-RAG, FLARE) may be plausible but are not evidenced in the provided excerpt, and the caption/table labeling mismatch reduces confidence in labeling fidelity."

However, readability is reduced by dense, small text (token stream, equations/notations like SRIND and H_i/a_max(i)), mixed visual styles, and limited whitespace; some elements look like they were scaled down from a larger diagram, making labels hard to parse at typical paper zoom.

However, it does not include many of the paper’s broader experimental/benchmarking elements (datasets, metrics, baselines, ablations) and provides only a schematic view of RIND/QFS without fully specifying their underlying computations beyond indicative symbols (e.g., H_l, a_max(i), s_i, S_RIND)."

The example (Einstein, 1903 job) makes the trigger and query formation intuitive.

The presence of a specific score expression/notation (e.g., token-level terms like H_l, a_max(i), s_i, and S_RIND with a threshold θ) is plausible for an illustrative diagram, but the exact symbols and numeric values shown could be more specific than what is explicitly guaranteed from the provided context; thus a small risk of introducing unverified formula/notation details."
