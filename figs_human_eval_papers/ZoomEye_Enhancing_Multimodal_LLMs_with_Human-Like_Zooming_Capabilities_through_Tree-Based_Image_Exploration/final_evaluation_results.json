It does not introduce new algorithms, loss functions, or equations. Minor risk: labeling the right-side branch as a distinct \"Local\" method could be interpreted as an additional mode beyond what the text explicitly contrasts (naive resize vs AnyRes), but it is still a plausible depiction of feeding only patches."

              "reason": "The relationships generally match the description: resizing precedes encoding; AnyRes corresponds to splitting into blocks and processing blocks (and typically the whole image) then integrating representations. However, the diagram’s structure could be read as AnyRes producing only local patches (or as an alternative to resizing) rather than the paper’s formulation that encodes both the global image I(0) and blocks I(1..a) and then integrates them. The figure does depict a “Global + Local” combination, but the causal flow (global image → AnyRes → blocks) is somewhat ambiguous compared to the formal definition."

The combined setting labeled \"Global + Local\" matches the text’s integration of whole-image and block representations. Slight imprecision: calling the right branch \"Local\" as a named method is not explicitly a paper-defined term, but it is descriptive rather than misleading."

However, the mapping remains fairly literal and conventional (standard zoom-in callout and pipeline arrows) rather than employing richer symbolic/metaphorical iconography."

However, it does not cover major algorithmic components central to the paper’s method description (tree-based hierarchical nodes/edges, confidence scoring, stopping criteria, node selection/backtracking), nor does it include the key preprocessing/formalism (e.g., naive vs AnyRes, tokenization equations) or any core formulas.

              "reason": "A reader can infer that Zoom Eye performs iterative patch-level search/zooming over high-resolution images to answer questions, since patches are highlighted and the caption states they are searched by Zoom Eye. The inclusion of resolutions, Q/A outcomes, and error analyses gives some intuition about what the system does. However, the operating principle is only implicit: the tree-based exploration, zoom-in/zoom-out behavior, and decision logic are not depicted, so the mechanism is not fully understandable from the figure alone."

The added terms like “Single type I cue / Type 2 cue”, “Union”, and the analysis blurbs (e.g., suggesting training-data deficiency) are interpretive but consistent with the paper’s described behavior and error analysis; they do not introduce new algorithms or equations.

              "reason": "The depicted relationship—Zoom Eye performs iterative patch-based exploration (zooming into sub-regions) to answer questions, sometimes succeeding and sometimes failing—is consistent with the paper’s described tree-based zoom-in/out navigation and search over sub-regions. The visual linkage (zoomed-in insets connected to the global image) correctly conveys hierarchical region exploration. The “Union” depiction (combining evidence from multiple searched patches) is plausible for aggregating explored regions, though the exact mechanism is not explicit in the provided text, making this relation slightly less verifiable."

              "reason": "Key labeling appears accurate: “Zoom Eye” is identified; searched regions are marked as red rectangles; the caption matches the paper’s claim that Zoom Eye searches patches. The example category labels “MO/Orientation” and “RS/Position” look like task-type labels rather than core method components; they are not confirmed in the provided excerpt and could be paper-specific shorthand. Also, the cue labels (“Single type I cue”, “Type 2 cue”, “Multiple type I cues”) are not corroborated by the excerpt, so label fidelity is slightly uncertain."

Color-coded panel framing helps structure, yet the visual hierarchy is weak: key takeaways are not immediately scannable without zooming in, and some elements (e.g., repeated resolution labels, extensive Q/A strings, and error-analysis text) add clutter that reduces legibility at typical paper viewing scale."

Multiple speech bubbles, icons, confidence lists, and patch navigation cues compete for attention, making the main flow harder to follow at typical paper viewing size. Some elements (decorative bubbles, repeated prompts, extra icons/checkmarks) add clutter without improving comprehension, while the core steps (select patch → zoom → recompute confidence → stop when answerable) are present but not cleanly foregrounded.
