  "caption": "Figure 1: We investigate the latent multi-hop reasoning of LLMs. For the first hop, we change the input prompt to refer to the bridge entity (Stevie Wonder) and check how often it increases the model’s internal recall of the bridge entity. For the second hop, we check if increasing this recall causes the model output to be more consistent with respect to what it knows about the bridge entity’s attribute (mother of Stevie Wonder).",
