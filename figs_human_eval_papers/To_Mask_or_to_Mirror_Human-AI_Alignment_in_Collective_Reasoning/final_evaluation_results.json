      "caption": "Figure 1: Overview of experimental stages and representative interface images for the Lost at Sea implementation. 1) Participants are randomly assigned to either an identified or pseudonymous condition, 2) deliberate in groups of four, 3) self-nominate for leader eligibility, and 4) elect a representative via ranked-choice voting. 5) Each participant also completes the survival task individually, allowing leader quality to be measured.",

              "score": 0.65,
              "reason": "The figure covers the core experimental pipeline (treatment manipulation: identified vs pseudonymous; group discussion; self-nomination; ranked-choice election; individual task used to score leader quality). However, it omits key analytic constructs emphasized in the paper context—e.g., alignment definition, optimal leader gap and its decomposition into self-/peer-exclusion, and the LLM simulation/matching procedure and counterfactual (no demographic context) condition. No formulas/metrics are depicted."

              "score": 0.85,
              "reason": "The staged layout and interface screenshots make the procedure easy to infer: participants are assigned to identity-visibility conditions, discuss, indicate willingness to lead, vote, and then performance of the elected representative is measured via an individual task. Minor details (e.g., how eligibility is determined from self-nomination, what exactly the survival task entails, and how group payout is computed) are present but somewhat dense in small text."

              "score": 0.35,
              "reason": "This is an experiment-overview figure rather than an end-to-end summary of the paper. It does not include the paper’s main comparative element (human vs multiple LLM groups), key outcomes (gender gap differences across conditions, alignment vs optimality results), or the paper’s main conceptual contribution (“mask vs mirror” tension). Thus it cannot be considered a full-paper summary."

              "score": 0.95,
              "reason": "The figure depicts only elements described in the provided paper context/caption: identified vs. pseudonymous treatment, group conversation, self-nomination, ranked-choice election, and an individual survival task used to measure leader quality. It does not introduce extraneous formulas or unexplained variables beyond those referenced (e.g., self-nomination, election, survival task). Minor risk: the use of symbols like E_i, W_i, and S_i^rep appears in the figure panels but is not explicitly defined in the provided excerpt (though they plausibly correspond to election, willingness, and representative score)."

              "score": 0.98,
              "reason": "The causal/temporal structure matches the described experiment: random assignment to identified/pseudonymous condition → group discussion in fours → self-nomination determining leader eligibility → ranked-choice vote selecting leader → leader performance (measured via individual survival task) determining group payout/leader quality. This aligns with the text’s description that all participants complete the task individually and the elected leader’s task performance determines the group’s reward."

            {
              "question": "2.3. Label Accuracy: Are the names of major components or methodologies mentioned in the paper accurately labeled?",
              "score": 0.97,
              "reason": "Key labels match the paper’s terminology: 'Identified condition', 'Pseudonymous condition', 'Conversation', 'Self-nomination', 'Election' (ranked-choice voting), and the 'survival task' in the Lost at Sea setting. The figure caption’s stage numbering and descriptions are consistent. Minor ambiguity stems from the subscripted notations (E_i, W_i, S_i^rep) not being clearly introduced in the provided excerpt, but the component names themselves are accurate."

              "question": "Overall Readability",
              "score": 0.78,
              "reason": "The left-to-right pipeline structure (Treatment → Group calibration → Election) is easy to follow, with numbered stages that map well onto the caption. Interface screenshots make the procedure concrete and support comprehension. However, readability is reduced by small font sizes within the UI screenshots, dense micro-text (e.g., chat content and task instructions) that is not essential for grasping the experimental logic, and some visual clutter from multiple nested panels. The key takeaways remain legible at the level of stage labels and numbering, but fine details are hard to read without zooming."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "Overall flow is clearly left-to-right across the three main columns (Treatment → Group calibration → Election). Within columns, numbered stages (1a/1b, 2/3, 4/5) provide additional guidance, though the mix of left-to-right columns and within-column vertical ordering introduces slight ambiguity."

              "score": 0.85,
              "reason": "Stages that belong together are grouped (treatment variants stacked; discussion and self-nomination in the middle; election and outcome task on the right). The survival task (stage 5) is near election (stage 4), which is appropriate, though it slightly competes for attention and could be visually separated as an outcome/measurement block."

              "question": "4.4. Alignment: Are nodes aligned neatly horizontally and vertically according to an invisible grid?",
              "score": 0.8,
              "reason": "The three main columns align well and the major panels have consistent widths. Minor misalignments exist in vertical spacing and baselines between subpanels (e.g., stage 3 panel height vs adjacent stage 2; stage 5’s inset content alignment), reducing grid crispness."

              "question": "4.5. Hierarchy: Do the important main components stand out in size, thickness, or position?",
              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "Column headers with colored bands establish strong primary structure, and numbered stages create secondary hierarchy. However, dense interface screenshots draw attention away from the conceptual structure; the hierarchy relies more on labels than on visual abstraction."
            },

              "question": "4.6. Margin: Is there sufficient margin between elements?",
              "score": 0.75,
              "reason": "There is reasonable whitespace between columns, but within columns the screenshots and descriptive text are tight (especially in the right column with stages 4 and 5). Some captions feel cramped relative to panel borders."
            },
            {
              "question": "4.7. Consistency: Are components with similar roles represented with the same shape and color?",
              "score": 0.85,
              "reason": "Panels share consistent screenshot framing and typographic treatment, and the three top-level phases use consistent colored header blocks. Minor inconsistency arises from varied screenshot styles (different UI elements/contrast) and differing panel emphasis (e.g., stage 4 list vs stage 5 image choices), which weakens uniform visual encoding."

              "score": 0.55,
              "reason": "The figure uses concrete UI screenshots (avatars, chat bubbles, voting cards) to embody abstract stages like identity visibility, deliberation, and election, which provides some metaphorical grounding. However, it largely stays literal (interface-as-illustration) rather than introducing symbolic visual metaphors (e.g., masking/mirroring motifs) that map more abstractly to the paper’s conceptual framing."

              "score": 0.35,
              "reason": "The overall look resembles standard experimental pipeline figures: pastel-colored stage headers, left-to-right arrows, and embedded interface panels. While the inclusion of realistic interface snippets adds specificity, the visual style and composition are close to common HCI/behavioral experiment overview templates and does not strongly differentiate itself."
            },

              "question": "5.3. Adaptability: Does it apply a layout more suitable for the specific paper, breaking away from uniform design principles?",
              "score": 0.45,
              "reason": "The layout is appropriately tailored to the experiment (two treatment branches, then shared downstream stages) and benefits from showing condition-specific UI. Still, it adheres to a conventional linear workflow structure and does not substantially depart from uniform design norms to emphasize the paper’s distinctive contribution (e.g., explicitly visualizing the mask-vs-mirror tension or human–LLM matching as a parallel track)."
