  "caption": "Figure 1: A visual example of calculating semantic drift (SD) score for paragraph P . The position which best splits the paragraph is k = 8. The proportion of supported facts to the left is 0.88 and the proportion of not-supported facts to the right is 0.78, giving an average of 0.83. The other positions all have lower SD scores, therefore the SD score of paragraph P is 0.83.",
