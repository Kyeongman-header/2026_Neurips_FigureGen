      "caption": "Figure 1: A visual example of calculating semantic drift (SD) score for paragraph P . The position which best splits the paragraph is k = 8. The proportion of supported facts to the left is 0.88 and the proportion of not-supported facts to the right is 0.78, giving an average of 0.83. The other positions all have lower SD scores, therefore the SD score of paragraph P is 0.83.",

              "score": 0.45,
              "reason": "The figure conveys the core intuition of the SD score (supported facts early, unsupported later) and illustrates how k is chosen along with the two proportions that are averaged. However, it omits key parts of the formal definition: the full max-over-k formulation, the SDm(P,k) piecewise condition, the 1/2 scaling, the hyperparameter m and its constraints on k, and explicit notation (N, si). So it covers the high-level computation but not the complete formula/components."

              "score": 0.8,
              "reason": "Yes for the SD-score operating principle: it shows a sequence of fact labels, a split point k, computing the fraction of supported facts on the left and not-supported facts on the right, and averaging them to yield SD(P). A reader can infer that the method searches for the best split. What is less clear standalone are details like the meaning of m/minimum-facts constraint and why the score is bounded/expected baseline near 0.5."

              "score": 0.1,
              "reason": "No. The figure is a local illustration of the SD score calculation only. It does not summarize the broader paper: experimental setup (FActScore pipeline), findings on drift distributions, early stopping methods, resample-then-rerank, API-call attempts, trade-offs, or results."

              "score": 1.0,
              "reason": "The figure only depicts the SD-score computation described in the provided paper excerpt: a sequence of fact labels (supported vs not supported), a split point k, the two proportions (supported on the left; not-supported on the right), and the resulting averaged score. No extra metrics, variables, or unexplained modules are introduced."

              "score": 0.95,
              "reason": "The relationships match the definition: choosing k to maximize the average of (left supported proportion) and (right not-supported proportion), yielding SD(P)=0.83 with k=8, left 7/8=0.88, right 7/9=0.78. Minor ambiguity remains because the paper’s formal definition includes a 1/2 factor outside SDm(P,k); the visualization directly presents the averaged value as SD0(P)=0.83 without explicitly showing the 1/2·(...) structure, but numerically it corresponds to the stated average."

              "reason": "Labels used (P, s0…s16, k, supported, not supported, SD0(P)) align with the paper’s notation and terminology (atomic-fact labels si, drift point k, SD score). The caption accurately names the semantic drift (SD) score and the meaning of the depicted quantities."

              "score": 0.86,
              "reason": "The figure is a compact schematic of the SD score computation (sequence of supported/unsupported facts, split point k, left/right proportions, and resulting SD), which directly reflects the paper’s core definition. It includes only minimal numeric examples to make the procedure concrete, without overloading with extraneous derivation."

              "score": 0.82,
              "reason": "It closely matches the caption and surrounding definition: the visual mapping from fact labels to a best split point is immediately interpretable and helps readers understand the argmax over k and the intuition of 'correct-then-incorrect'. Minor readability friction comes from small text/notation (s_i, k, fractions) that may require zooming or prior exposure to the formula."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "The design is utilitarian: color blocks encode labels, arrows/annotations show the computed ratios, and no decorative graphics are present. The only slight redundancy is repeating supported/not supported in both color and text, but it serves clarity rather than distraction."

              "score": 0.85,
              "reason": "The left and right segments are visually grouped with their corresponding ratio annotations placed nearby; the SD result is centered below. Minor room remains to bring some text slightly closer to the elements they summarize."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "The fact blocks are uniformly sized and aligned on a single baseline; labels and the k-marker are consistently placed. The lower annotations are mostly well-centered under their respective spans."

              "reason": "The split point k is clearly highlighted with an arrow and the final SD score is emphasized at the bottom. However, the relative importance of the main outcome (SD value) versus intermediate ratios could be made more prominent via typography (size/weight) or visual emphasis."

              "reason": "Spacing is generally adequate: blocks, labels, and bracket lines do not crowd each other. The bottom equation/label area is slightly tight, but still readable."

              "score": 0.95,
              "reason": "All facts are consistently shown as equal rectangles; supported vs. not-supported is consistently encoded with green vs. red across the sequence, and labels use a uniform style."

              "score": 0.55,
              "reason": "The figure concretizes the abstract notion of “semantic drift” via a color-coded sequence (green/red) of fact labels and a marked split point k, effectively turning an abstract metric into an intuitive visual metaphor (before/after drift). However, it relies on standard statistical/diagrammatic conventions (bars, proportions) rather than richer or more distinctive symbolic/iconic metaphors."

              "score": 0.35,
              "reason": "The visualization is clear but stylistically conventional: a labeled bar sequence with annotations and fraction callouts. The color blocking and split-point marker are common devices in ML/NLP papers, with limited distinctive visual language beyond clean execution."

              "question": "5.3. Adaptability: Does it apply a layout more suitable for the specific paper, breaking away from uniform design principles?",
              "score": 0.65,
              "reason": "The layout is tailored to the paper’s core definition by directly illustrating how SD is computed (showing s_i, the maximizing k, and the two terms averaged). It departs from generic “pipeline” or “box-and-arrow” templates by aligning the diagram with the metric’s mechanics. Still, it remains within standard explanatory-figure patterns and does not strongly innovate in layout."
