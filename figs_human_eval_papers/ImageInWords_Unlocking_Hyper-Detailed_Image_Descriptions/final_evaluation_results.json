However, it omits several major paper elements tied to the claimed contributions: the human SxS evaluation rubric/axes (comprehensiveness, specificity, hallucinations, etc.), dataset/benchmark releases (IIW-Eval) and annotation artifacts, and downstream evaluation setups (text-to-image fidelity ranking; reasoning benchmarks like ARO/SVO-Probes/Winoground).

              "reason": "A reader can infer the operating principle without the paper: machine-generated seeds are produced at object and image level; humans iteratively correct/enrich them; object-level captions feed into image-level description creation; multiple raters refine outputs; and data is used to improve the VLM seed generator via active learning. The flowchart structure and labels make the process mostly understandable. Minor ambiguities remain (e.g., what specific VLM is used, how active learning selects samples/updates models, and what exactly each annotation task interface requires), but the high-level mechanism is clear."
