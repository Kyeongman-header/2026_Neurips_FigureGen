However, wording like “support of Q that generates P” is ambiguous, and the figure does not specify what “support” means operationally for text (sampling, representation space, thresholding), so one cannot reliably infer how to compute the metrics from the figure alone."

It does not introduce extra metrics or equations. Minor concern: the caption’s wording about “support” and “proportion” implies a set-based definition (and even includes a notation like P(Supp(Q)) in the panel label) that may not exactly match the paper’s operational kNN/manifold-style estimation details, but it is still within the paper’s conceptual scope rather than an unrelated addition."

However, the caption’s specific relationships are stated incorrectly/ambiguously: (b) says “Precision is the proportion of the support of Q that generates P,” which reverses/garbles the usual interpretation (precision is about how much of Q lies in/near P; i.e., generated samples are realistic). (c) says “Recall is the proportion of the support P generated by Q,” which is closer to the idea of coverage of P by Q, but still imprecise. The set/support phrasing is not a faithful statement of the paper’s estimator-based definition and can misrepresent directionality."

The only label-level issue is the imprecise use of “support”/“generated by” in the panel/caption text (and the panel label suggesting P(Supp(Q))), which can be misleading relative to the paper’s definitions, though it is not a wrong naming of methods/components per se."

However, readability is reduced by (i) low-contrast, semi-transparent fills that can blur boundaries (especially in panel a), (ii) small, light axis/contour lines that may degrade in print or when resized, and (iii) reliance on color alone (red/blue) to distinguish P and Q, which may be problematic for color-vision deficiencies and grayscale reproduction. Panel labels are clear, but the conceptual emphasis could be strengthened by sharper outlines, higher contrast, and/or direct annotations indicating ‘support’ regions."
