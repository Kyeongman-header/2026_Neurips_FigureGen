              "reason": "The figure conveys the core idea of KnowAda: given an image + dense caption and a target VLM, identify knowledge gaps and edit the caption accordingly (with visual indication of removed/kept text). However, it omits several major components emphasized in the paper’s contributions and method description, notably the explicit 3-stage pipeline details (question generation, knowledge probing, LLM rephrase), thresholds/decision criteria for “unknown,” and the DNLI evaluation framework and results. No formulas/metrics are shown."

              "reason": "Largely yes at a high level: it shows input dense caption + image, interaction with “KnowAda” and “Your VLM,” and an output caption where certain details are removed (red strike-through) and others retained (green), implying adaptation to the model’s capabilities. Still, key mechanics are underspecified in the figure alone (how gaps are detected, what tool edits the caption, and what governs which spans are removed), so the operational principle is understandable but not fully clear."

              "reason": "No. The figure focuses narrowly on the motivating example and the notion of knowledge-adapted caption editing.

No extraneous formulas or unintroduced modules are shown. Minor risk: the explicit red/green edit-marking style is a visualization choice not explicitly specified as part of the method, but it does not introduce new methodological components."

The figure is a conceptual schematic and omits intermediate steps (question generation, probing, LLM rephrasing) that are detailed elsewhere (Figure 2), but it does not misstate the directionality or purpose of the adaptation."

              "reason": "The figure communicates the core idea (adapting dense captions based on a VLM’s knowledge gaps) via a clear before/after caption edit and a central KnowAda block. However, readability is reduced by the very long dense caption text blocks; the fine-grained red/green edits and small font make the key takeaway harder to grasp quickly."

              "reason": "As a supplement, it aligns well with the paper narrative: it visually illustrates the transformation from original to knowledge-adapted caption and shows the role of the VLM. Still, the amount of text and the small, detailed markup require zooming/effort, which weakens its effectiveness in typical conference PDF viewing conditions."

              "reason": "Some visual elements feel non-essential for readability (e.g., the robot icon, pencil icon, and large full caption blocks with many specific details).

              "reason": "Major blocks are mostly aligned (top text box centered; bottom text box centered; middle row roughly on a grid). However, the left image and right VLM icon feel slightly imbalanced relative to the central KnowAda box, weakening strict grid alignment."

              "reason": "The figure concretizes the abstract idea of “knowledge gaps” via a clear before/after caption edit visualization (red strike-through deletions and green insertions) and a central boxed “KnowAda” module. However, the use of generic clip-art style icons (pencil, robot) is only moderately metaphorical and does not introduce a distinctive symbolic system beyond common ML pipeline conventions."

              "reason": "The overall visual language resembles a standard method overview: input (image + caption) → processing block → output (edited caption). The novelty mainly comes from showing text edits directly inside the output caption, but the typography, arrows, and iconography are conventional and close to typical computational linguistics/ML figures."

              "reason": "The layout is tailored to the paper’s core contribution (caption adaptation) by juxtaposing the original dense caption, the image, the KnowAda operation, and the adapted caption with explicit edit markings. This supports the specific narrative (removing uncertain details) more effectively than a generic block diagram, though it still largely follows common left-to-right / top-to-bottom pipeline structure."
