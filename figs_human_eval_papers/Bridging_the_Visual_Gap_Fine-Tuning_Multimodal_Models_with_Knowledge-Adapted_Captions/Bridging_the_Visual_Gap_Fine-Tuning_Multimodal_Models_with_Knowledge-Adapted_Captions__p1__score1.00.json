  "caption": "Figure 2: Our proposed KnowAda pipeline. We first probe the knowledge of the VLM, identifying the known and unknown parts of the image description, by generating questions about the visual content of the image mentioned in the caption. Then, KnowAda identifies the knowledge gaps by judging the VLM answers to these questions. Finally, KnowAda adapt the description to match these gaps (e.g., removing the number of limousines mentioned in the caption, which relates to a question the model failed to answer).",
