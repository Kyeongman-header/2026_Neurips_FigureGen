              "reason": "The figure covers the paper’s core high-level comparison among (i) data preprocessing + retraining, (ii) DP training + retraining, and (iii) the proposed knowledge unlearning via a few updates on target token sequences, and it highlights the RTBF motivation and relative compute costs. However, it omits many major elements discussed in the paper: the specific unlearning mechanism (gradient ascent / maximizing loss on target sequences), the sequential-vs-batch unlearning finding, the evaluation setup (GPT-Neo sizes, downstream tasks), the extraction-attack framing, and the proposed extraction-likelihood metric (varying prefix length).

              "reason": "A reader can infer the main operating principle: instead of sanitizing data or using DP (both requiring costly retraining), the model can be updated post hoc using the specific token sequences to be forgotten, achieving RTBF with minimal compute. The visual pipeline and annotations make the contrast clear. The only limitation is that the exact optimization direction/criterion for “unlearning” is not explained in the figure itself."

The only potential over-specificity is the inclusion of concrete GPU-day cost estimates (~900 A100, ~1800 A100, ~0.001 A100), which appear in the paper text around the figure but could be interpreted as extra-detail; otherwise no clear unmentioned components are added."

              "reason": "The causal flow is faithful: (1) data preprocessing involves finding/removing sensitive data from pretraining corpora followed by retraining; (2) differential privacy is depicted as retraining with a DP algorithm; (3) knowledge unlearning is depicted as post-hoc parameter updates using target token sequences rather than full retraining. This matches the paper’s framing that unlearning is a post-hoc alternative requiring only a few updates."

However, the overall structure remains a standard comparative pipeline layout rather than a notably customized or unconventional arrangement tailored to this specific contribution."

Still, the mechanism is only implied (“few token updates”) rather than explained (e.g., gradient ascent on the sequence), so the operational details and why it works are not fully inferable."

It uses an illustrative PII example (\"Bob\") which is a schematic instance rather than a claimed dataset artifact, and it does not introduce new algorithms or formulas beyond the paper’s narrative comparison. Minor concern: the specific GPU-day numbers are quantitative claims; they appear consistent with the paper’s framing in the excerpt but still function as precise values that must match the paper exactly."

              "reason": "The causal/processing relationships are correctly depicted: (i) preprocessing implies finding/removing sensitive data then retraining; (ii) differential privacy is applied during (re)training; (iii) knowledge unlearning operates post hoc on an existing LM via a small number of updates on target token sequences, motivated by RTBF requests. This matches the paper’s stated motivation (avoid full retraining; post-hoc unlearning via gradient ascent on target sequences). Minor ambiguity: DP is portrayed as always requiring full retraining, whereas some DP approaches can be at decoding/inference time (the paper later mentions DP decoding), but as a high-level comparison it remains broadly faithful."
