However, it omits several major elements central to the paper’s method/analysis, such as the visual forgetting diagnostic (progressive image removal), attention-decay analysis, and the core TVC inference-time mechanism (take-along visual conditioning / shifting image input to critical stages / dynamic visual token pruning). No formulas (e.g., the formalization with V and T tokens) appear."

              "reason": "As a self-contained depiction of the *data generation pipeline*, it is fairly understandable: inputs (image+question) go to a data generator; candidate responses are produced with iterative sampling and best-of-N resampling; then a response filtering stage yields a cleaned dataset with named filtering operations. The arrows and stage separation convey process flow. However, several labels are high-level and undefined (what constitutes “Data Generator,” what criteria drive the green check/red X, what “Reflection Word Pruning” precisely is), so a reader can grasp the pipeline structure but not the detailed operating principle or how it relates to mitigating visual forgetting."

However, the caption claims “iterative distillation” and ties the specific sub-steps (best-of-N resampling, iterative sampling, token truncation, reflection-word pruning) into a precise workflow; these relationships are not confirmable from the provided text (which focuses on shifting image conditioning and dynamic pruning during reasoning, not a full data-generation pipeline).

Many internal labels (e.g., “Reflection Word Pruning”, “Dataset Filtering”, “Best-of-N Resampling”) are not corroborated by the provided context, so label accuracy is mixed: TVC naming is correct, but most module names are unverified."

              "reason": "The two-stage structure (pink vs blue) provides hierarchy and separates main phases.

But it is not fully standalone: axes/normalization are not rigorously defined (what exactly is summed, over heads/layers/tokens; how ‘proportion’ is computed; what the middle layer is), and the broader system/algorithmic principle (TVC) is not depicted, so one cannot understand how the proposed method works from this figure alone."

However, it omits several major paper components: the formal setup (e.g., the paper’s equation-level framing like C_MLLM = f(V, T1..Tn)), the dynamic pruning/compression mechanism, when/where image tokens are shifted in the long-CoT pipeline, and any quantitative results/benchmarks.

The attention heatmap depiction (image tokens receiving less attention over time; re-attending to image tokens later) aligns with the described diagnostic and motivation.
