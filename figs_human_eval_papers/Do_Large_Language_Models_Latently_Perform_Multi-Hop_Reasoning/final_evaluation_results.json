      "caption": "Figure 1: We investigate the latent multi-hop reasoning of LLMs. For the first hop, we change the input prompt to refer to the bridge entity (Stevie Wonder) and check how often it increases the model’s internal recall of the bridge entity. For the second hop, we check if increasing this recall causes the model output to be more consistent with respect to what it knows about the bridge entity’s attribute (mother of Stevie Wonder).",

              "score": 0.45,
              "reason": "The figure captures the paper’s core two-hop setup (2H prompt vs. 1H recall-based prompt), the notions of Hop 1 (bridge entity recall) and Hop 2 (attribute utilization via consistency), and the direction of causal testing (increase recall → check consistency). However, it omits most major experimental/technical components needed to reflect the paper’s methods: the explicit definitions/implementation details of entity recall score (projection of hidden states, which token/layer, aggregation), the definition of consistency score (distributional comparison), the intervention mechanism used to increase recall, dataset construction (TWOHOPFACT, 52 composition types), evaluation protocol (frequency-of-causal-effects analysis), and scaling/model comparisons. No formulas or precise metric definitions appear."

              "score": 0.65,
              "reason": "A reader can infer the high-level principle: for a two-hop prompt, test whether the model internally recalls an intermediate entity (Hop 1) and whether boosting that recall makes the output align with what the model knows for the corresponding one-hop prompt (Hop 2, consistency). The example (Superstition → Stevie Wonder → mother) and the labels “Entity Recall” and “Consistency” support this. Still, key operational details are unclear from the figure alone (what ‘internal recall’ means computationally, how recall is ‘increased’, and how ‘consistency’ is measured), so it is only partially self-explanatory."

              "score": 0.15,
              "reason": "The figure is an introductory conceptual overview of the proposed latent two-hop pathway tests. It does not summarize the paper end-to-end: it excludes dataset details, breadth of relation/composition types, experimental setup, results patterns (e.g., strong Hop 1 vs weaker Hop 2, co-occurrence rates), scaling findings, and broader implications/limitations. It is not intended as a full-paper summary."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "The figure sticks to the paper’s described elements: two prompts (two-hop and one-hop), a bridge entity (“Stevie Wonder”), and the two measured notions (“Entity Recall” for Hop 1 and “Consistency” for Hop 2), plus an intervention icon suggesting increasing recall. Minor ambiguity: the figure visually introduces bar-chart-like distributions and an intervention “x” symbol without explicitly naming the specific method (e.g., how recall is increased), but these are schematic and not clearly asserting extra, paper-unsupported mechanisms."

              "score": 0.85,
              "reason": "The causal/analytical storyline matches the paper: (Hop 1) modifying the two-hop prompt to refer to/align with the bridge entity is used to test increased internal bridge-entity recall; (Hop 2) increasing entity recall is then tested for whether it raises consistency between the two-hop completion distribution and the one-hop (bridge-entity) prompt distribution. The only potential fidelity issue is that the figure’s top prompt is rendered as “The mother of Stevie Wonder is” whereas the paper’s example/caption includes “is named” in some places; this is a minor mismatch in prompt wording but does not alter the depicted relationships."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "Key labels used in the paper are correctly named and placed: “Entity Recall” aligned with Hop 1 and “Consistency” aligned with Hop 2; the bridge entity is correctly labeled as “Stevie Wonder.” The hop numbering and association with the respective prompts are consistent with the caption. Minor inconsistency: the lower prompt includes a crossed-out distractor (“Thriller”) and a replacement (“Superstition”), which is not a standard label from the paper, though it serves as an illustrative edit rather than a mislabeled method."

              "score": 0.78,
              "reason": "The figure abstracts the method into two clearly labeled steps (Hop 1: entity recall; Hop 2: consistency via intervention), which aligns with the paper’s main contribution. However, some visual elements (multiple mini-histograms, crossed-out token, duplicated LLM boxes) add detail without substantially improving the schematic clarity, slightly diluting the focus."

              "score": 0.84,
              "reason": "With the caption, the figure supports understanding of the experimental setup: contrasting a two-hop prompt with an equivalent one-hop recall prompt, and highlighting the measured quantities (entity recall vs. output consistency). The hop arrows and color-coding help map caption terms to components, though small plot glyphs and some token-level annotations are hard to interpret at a glance without prior context."

              "score": 0.66,
              "reason": "It mostly stays on-topic, but includes arguably redundant/decorative components (multiple bar-chart icons, shading/embellishments, the crossed-out word example, repeated 'LLM' panels) that are not strictly necessary to convey the causal tests. Simplifying these could improve readability and reduce cognitive load."

              "score": 0.85,
              "reason": "The figure has a clear top-to-bottom structure (one-hop prompt on top, two-hop prompt on bottom) with arrows labeled Hop 1 and Hop 2 indicating progression. Some elements (histogram-like bars and rotated 'Consistency' label) introduce mild directional ambiguity, but overall flow is readable."

              "reason": "The two main hop arrows are separated and do not appear to cross; callouts and pointer arrows are arranged to avoid intersections. Visual clutter is limited, with no obvious line crossings."

              "score": 0.8,
              "reason": "Each LLM block is colocated with its corresponding prompt text, and the hop arrows connect the related regions. However, the metric indicators (entity recall bars and consistency bars) are somewhat dispersed (one embedded in the lower box, others floating near the top/right), slightly weakening proximity grouping."

              "reason": "The two main rounded rectangles are neatly stacked and aligned, and text baselines are mostly consistent. Still, several annotations (bars, rotated labels, hop arrows at angles, and overlaid token highlights) break grid regularity."

              "question": "4.5. Hierarchy: Do the important main components stand out in size, thickness, or position?",
              "score": 0.85,
              "reason": "The two large LLM panels dominate and are clearly the primary components, with hop arrows emphasizing the key causal pathway. Secondary elements (token highlights and bar charts) are visually smaller and read as annotations."

              "question": "4.6. Margin: Is there sufficient margin between elements?",
              "score": 0.65,
              "reason": "Spacing inside the lower panel is tight: multiple overlays (entity recall bars, hop arrows, token highlights, and a small module icon) compete for space. While not illegible, margins feel constrained, especially around the bottom prompt and embedded bars."

              "score": 0.8,
              "reason": "Both LLM components use the same rounded-rectangle style and gray treatment, and hop arrows are consistently styled. Color coding for concepts is mostly consistent (e.g., entity name in orange, descriptive mention in purple), though the use of multiple accent colors and varying bar-chart styles slightly reduces uniformity."

              "score": 0.62,
              "reason": "Uses concrete visual metaphors for latent processes: bar charts as “entity recall/consistency,” arrows labeled Hop 1/Hop 2 for causal traversal, and the bridge entity highlighted in color. However, the metaphoric vocabulary stays fairly standard (arrows, highlights, histograms) rather than introducing richer or more distinctive symbolic encodings."

              "score": 0.44,
              "reason": "Clean, modern schematic with mild stylistic flair (layered LLM boxes, color-coded tokens), but overall resembles common ML paper cartoons (stacked model blocks + arrows + small distribution plots). The design is polished yet not especially distinctive or unconventional."

              "score": 0.67,
              "reason": "Layout is tailored to the paper’s two-hop thesis: explicitly juxtaposes one-hop vs two-hop prompts, visually ties the bridge entity to both hops, and maps proposed metrics onto the pipeline. It departs from generic block diagrams by integrating the prompt text and metric visualizations directly into the causal story, though it still follows familiar left-to-right/stacked-flow conventions."
