      "caption": "Figure 1: While large language models (LLMs) offer strong zero/few-shot performance, they are challenging to serve in practice. Traditional ways of training small task-specific models, on the other hand, requires large amount of training data. We propose Distilling step-by-step, a new paradigm that extracts rationales from LLMs as informative task knowledge into training small models, which reduces both the deployed model size as well as the data required for training.",

But the operating principle (how rationales are obtained and used, what training paradigm changes) is not understandable from the plot alone; it functions more as a conceptual positioning chart than an explanatory mechanism diagram."

However, the figure suggests a single-point dominance (better accuracy and less data) relative to both baselines in a generic way, whereas the paper’s results are benchmark-/setting-dependent (e.g., fine-tuning vs distillation vs prompted LLMs), so the universality is somewhat stronger than strictly justified."

It highlights the proposed method as dominating prior paradigms (higher accuracy, less data, smaller size).

Still, as a supplement to the paper’s detailed claims, it is somewhat underspecified: no dataset/task context, no numeric scales, and ambiguous directionality/magnitude of improvements.
