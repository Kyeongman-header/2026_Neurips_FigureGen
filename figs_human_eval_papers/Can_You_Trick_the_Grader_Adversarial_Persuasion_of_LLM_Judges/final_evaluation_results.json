      "caption": "Figure 1: Given a math question and a candidate solution, the LLM judge evaluates the correctness of the response. When persuasive language is embedded in the solution, the model assigns unfairly inflated scores despite no improvement in factual correctness.",

              "score": 0.45,
              "reason": "The figure captures the core setup (math question + candidate solution + LLM judge + score) and illustrates one persuasion technique (Consistency) causing score inflation on an incorrect solution. However, it omits most major components described in the paper context: the full set of seven persuasion techniques, multiple benchmarks, multiple LLM judges/models, quantitative results (e.g., up to 8% average inflation), pairwise evaluation setting, and counter-prompting/defense analyses. No key formulas appear to be required here, but the experimental components are largely not covered."

              "score": 0.8,
              "reason": "Yes. The figure clearly communicates the pipeline: an evaluation prompt instructs an LLM judge to grade a math solution for correctness; adding persuasive language (highlighted) to an otherwise identical solution can increase the assigned score even though correctness is unchanged. The example scores and check/cross markers help convey the vulnerability without needing the paper."

              "score": 0.15,
              "reason": "No. This is an introductory illustrative example rather than an end-to-end summary. It does not summarize the full study (definitions of all persuasion techniques, the breadth of experiments across datasets/models, measured effect sizes, analysis of combining techniques, pairwise judging, robustness to counter-prompts, and implications/defenses). It only depicts a single motivating instance."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "The figure contents align with the paper’s described setup (Question, Evaluation Prompt, Candidate Solution, Candidate Solution w/ Persuasion (Consistency), LLM Judge, and score change). The arithmetic example (40 minutes/day × 5 days) and the notion of score inflation are consistent with the paper context. Minor risk: the exact numeric scores (2.6 → 3.1) and the specific worded prompt text may be illustrative rather than verbatim from the paper, but they do not introduce new methods/components beyond what the paper discusses."

              "score": 0.95,
              "reason": "The causal relationship depicted—adding persuasive language (Consistency) to an otherwise identical candidate solution can increase an LLM judge’s score despite unchanged correctness—matches the stated main finding and the described experimental manipulation. The pipeline (Question + Candidate Solution + Evaluation Prompt → LLM Judge → score) is represented correctly."

              "score": 0.95,
              "reason": "Labels such as “LLM Judge,” “Evaluation Prompt,” “Candidate Solution,” and “Candidate Solution w/ Persuasion (Consistency)” match the terminology and the identified persuasion technique (Consistency) from the paper. No major methodology/component appears mislabeled."

              "score": 0.78,
              "reason": "The figure communicates the main idea (persuasion text inserted into an otherwise identical solution leads to a higher judge score) with a clear before/after contrast, labeled sections, and an outcome summary (2.6 vs 3.1). However, readability is somewhat reduced by small/dense text (especially in the prompt/question blocks), reliance on color (red emphasis) for key differences, and slight visual clutter from repeated elements and icons that do not add much beyond the numeric comparison. The core message remains understandable at a glance, but fine details are hard to read and some elements feel redundant."

              "score": 0.85,
              "reason": "Both the top illustrative pipeline and the bottom mini-schematics convey a clear sequential flow (inputs → LLM judge → score). While the page mixes a large callout panel with a smaller left-to-right arrow strip, the primary reading order remains understandable."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "Evaluation prompt, question, and candidate solution are grouped together, and the persuasion variant is placed directly below the baseline for easy comparison. Output scores are placed close to the judging step in the bottom schematic."

              "question": "4.4. Alignment: Are nodes aligned neatly horizontally and vertically according to an invisible grid?",
              "score": 0.8,
              "reason": "Within each panel, text blocks and headers align reasonably, and the bottom flow diagrams follow a clean horizontal alignment. However, the overall composition (large top panel plus bottom strip) is not perfectly grid-regular, and some elements appear slightly offset due to varying box sizes."

              "score": 0.88,
              "reason": "Key elements (Candidate Solution vs Candidate Solution w/ Persuasion) are emphasized via bold headers and color (red persuasive sentence), and the outcome difference is highlighted with large numeric scores and check/cross marks. The hierarchy is generally clear despite some text density."

              "score": 0.78,
              "reason": "Internal padding in the main callout box is acceptable, but the figure is somewhat compact: multiple boxes and annotations are tightly packed, making the layout feel slightly crowded, especially around the candidate-solution text lines."
            },

              "question": "4.7. Consistency: Are components with similar roles represented with the same shape and color?",
              "score": 0.87,
              "reason": "Baseline and persuasion versions use consistent box styling and typography; emphasis is consistently applied (red for persuasive content, icons for correct/incorrect). Minor inconsistency arises from mixing two depiction styles (detailed text panel vs simplified arrow schematic) within one figure."

              "score": 0.55,
              "reason": "The figure uses concrete visual cues (LLM judge robot icon, checkmark/cross, arrows, numeric score changes) to stand in for abstract processes like evaluation and bias. However, much of the concept is still conveyed through literal UI-like text boxes and annotations rather than richer symbolic/metaphoric encoding."

              "question": "5.2. Novelty: Does the generated image have a unique style that differentiates it from common templates?",
              "score": 0.42,
              "reason": "The composition resembles a fairly standard NLP/ML paper schematic: boxed inputs/outputs, arrows, an illustrative example, and a small icon for the model. The red persuasive-text highlight adds some distinctiveness, but overall the style is close to common pipeline-diagram templates."
            },
            {
              "question": "5.3. Adaptability: Does it apply a layout more suitable for the specific paper, breaking away from uniform design principles?",
              "score": 0.6,
              "reason": "It adapts the layout to the paper’s key claim by juxtaposing the original solution vs. the persuasion-augmented solution and visually tying each to differing judge scores, which effectively communicates the causal contrast. Still, it remains within conventional left-to-right pipeline framing and standardized boxed sections."
