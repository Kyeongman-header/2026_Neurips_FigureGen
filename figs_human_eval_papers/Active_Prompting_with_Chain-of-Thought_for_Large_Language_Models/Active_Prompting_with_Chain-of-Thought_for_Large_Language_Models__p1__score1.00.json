  "caption": "Figure 1: Illustrations of our proposed approach. There are four stages. (1) Uncertainty Estimation: with or without a few human-written chain-of-thoughts, we query the large language model k (k “ 5 in this illustration) times to generate possible answers with intermediate steps for a set of training questions. Then, we calculate the uncertainty u based on k answers via an uncertainty metric (we use disagreement in this illustration). (2) Selection: according to the uncertainty, we select the most uncertain questions for annotation. (3) Annotation: we involve humans to annotate the selected questions. (4) Inference: infer each question with the new annotated exemplars.",
