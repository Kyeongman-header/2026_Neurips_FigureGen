      "caption": "Figure 1: Illustrations of our proposed approach. There are four stages. (1) Uncertainty Estimation: with or without a few human-written chain-of-thoughts, we query the large language model k (k “ 5 in this illustration) times to generate possible answers with intermediate steps for a set of training questions. Then, we calculate the uncertainty u based on k answers via an uncertainty metric (we use disagreement in this illustration). (2) Selection: according to the uncertainty, we select the most uncertain questions for annotation. (3) Annotation: we involve humans to annotate the selected questions. (4) Inference: infer each question with the new annotated exemplars.",

              "score": 0.72,
              "reason": "The figure clearly covers the core pipeline components (k-sample generation for uncertainty estimation, uncertainty ranking/selection, human annotation to form exemplars E, and inference with new exemplars) and visually instantiates one uncertainty metric (disagreement) with u values. However, it omits other major uncertainty metrics discussed (entropy, variance, self-confidence) and does not depict key formal elements introduced in text (e.g., dataset notation D_tr/D_te, budget n, exemplar structure with (q,c,a), or how uncertainty is computed beyond a simple illustrative ratio). So it is strong on the method’s main modules but incomplete on breadth of metrics and formal definitions."

              "score": 0.86,
              "reason": "Yes: the four numbered stages, arrows, and concrete examples make the operating principle understandable—sample multiple CoT answers per unlabeled question, compute uncertainty, pick the most uncertain questions, get humans to annotate them, and then use those as exemplars for downstream inference. Minor ambiguities remain (what exactly constitutes 'uncertainty' beyond disagreement; what k is in general; whether few-shot vs zero-shot CoT is required/optional; and how exemplars are inserted into prompts), but the overall workflow is clear from the figure alone."

              "score": 0.34,
              "reason": "No: the figure is a schematic of the proposed approach, not a full-paper summary. It does not include experimental setup across eight datasets, baselines, results, ablations (pool sizes, zero-shot vs few-shot analyses), accuracy–uncertainty relationships, or conclusions/limitations. It captures the central method but not the end-to-end narrative or empirical findings that constitute a large portion of the paper."

              "score": 0.95,
              "reason": "The figure depicts the four-stage pipeline described (uncertainty estimation via k samples, selection of most-uncertain questions, human annotation to create exemplars E, then inference with E). It also uses a concrete uncertainty example (disagreement) consistent with the text. Minor issue: the visual shows numeric labels (1–5) and u = 1/5, 4/5, 5/5 as an illustrative calculation; while aligned with disagreement, the exact numeric mapping is illustrative rather than a formally defined formula in the caption/text excerpt, but it does not introduce a conflicting method."

              "score": 0.93,
              "reason": "Relationships are faithful: querying the LLM k times on unlabeled training questions → compute uncertainty u from the k answers → rank/select top-n uncertain questions → humans annotate them to form exemplars E → prepend E for inference on test questions. The optionality of using few-shot CoT vs zero-shot CoT during uncertainty estimation is represented and matches “with or without a few human-written chain-of-thoughts.” No apparent inversion or missing dependency among the core steps."

              "score": 0.96,
              "reason": "Key labels align with the paper: “Uncertainty Estimation,” “Selection,” “Annotation,” “Inference,” “Most Uncertain Questions,” “Uncertainty Ranking,” “New Exemplars E,” and “Few-shot CoT / Zero-shot CoT.” The notation k=5 and u (uncertainty) are consistent with the described setup. Minor formatting/typography differences (e.g., k “ 5 in caption rendering) are non-substantive."

              "score": 0.83,
              "reason": "The figure cleanly presents the four-stage pipeline (uncertainty estimation → selection → annotation → inference), which is the main contribution, and uses minimal examples to concretize each step. However, several embedded text snippets (full word-problem fragments, partial CoT/answers, and multiple question IDs) add detail that slightly distracts from the core algorithmic idea."

              "score": 0.88,
              "reason": "It aligns well with the caption and manuscript narrative: the stages are numbered, the flow is left-to-right, and key variables (k queries, uncertainty u, exemplar set E) appear in situ, making it useful for readers to map text to process. Readability is somewhat reduced by small font in the example boxes, which may limit its effectiveness when printed or viewed at column width."

              "score": 0.76,
              "reason": "Most visual elements support the pipeline, but there is some redundancy: repeated question text blocks, multiple illustrative answer tiles, and a prominent LLM icon are not strictly necessary to convey the method. The figure could be more concise by reducing example verbosity and collapsing repeated question lists while retaining the uncertainty-ranking and exemplar-selection concept."

              "reason": "Overall margins are acceptable, but several regions are information-dense (notably within Uncertainty Estimation and the right-side Annotation/Inference panel), with tight spacing around text boxes that can reduce readability at paper scale."

              "score": 0.85,
              "reason": "Stages use consistent boxed grouping and labeling; questions are consistently shown as rounded rectangles. However, mixed visual metaphors (e.g., cylinder for selected questions, varied color blocks for samples/answers) slightly weakens uniformity."

              "score": 0.62,
              "reason": "The figure maps abstract stages (uncertainty estimation, selection, annotation, inference) to a stepwise pipeline with clear labeled modules, arrows, and container shapes, plus a few concrete visual cues (ranking list, cylinder for selected set, “LLM” icon). However, most concepts are still conveyed primarily via text and standard boxes rather than richer metaphorical/iconographic encoding (e.g., uncertainty as gauges/heatmaps, annotation as human-in-the-loop symbols)."

              "reason": "The overall style closely follows common ML paper schematics: rounded rectangles, left-to-right pipeline, numbered stages, arrows, and small illustrative text snippets. While polished, it does not introduce a notably distinctive visual language or unconventional illustrative style beyond minor embellishments (colored tiles for samples, small icon)."

              "score": 0.55,
              "reason": "The layout is tailored to the method by explicitly separating the four stages and showing both few-shot and zero-shot CoT options within the uncertainty-estimation block, which aligns with the paper’s narrative. Still, it largely adheres to a standard modular flowchart paradigm rather than significantly departing from uniform design conventions or employing task-specific visual encodings (e.g., uncertainty distributions, selection criteria visualization) that would more strongly customize the layout."
