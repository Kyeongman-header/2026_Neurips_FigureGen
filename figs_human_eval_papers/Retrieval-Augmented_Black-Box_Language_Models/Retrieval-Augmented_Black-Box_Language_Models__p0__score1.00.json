  "caption": "Figure 1: Different from previous retrieval-augmented approaches (Borgeaud et al., 2022) that enhance a language model with retrieval by updating the LM’s parameters, REPLUG treats the LM as a black box and augments it with a frozen or tunable retriever. This black-box assumption makes REPLUG applicable to large LMs, which are often served via APIs.",
