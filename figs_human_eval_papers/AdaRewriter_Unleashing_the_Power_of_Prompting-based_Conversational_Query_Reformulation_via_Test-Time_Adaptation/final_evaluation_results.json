              "score": 0.72,
              "reason": "The figure captures the core pipeline elements emphasized in the excerpt: (q,H) input, LLM sampling to produce N candidate reformulations (S1..Sn), a training-time ranking/assessment stage tied to retrieval outcomes, training a lightweight reward model, and inference-time Best-of-N selection using the reward model (and applicability to black-box LLM APIs is implied via generic LLM icons). However, it omits key methodological specifics such as the contrastive ranking loss, the exact definition S= q-hat ⊕ r-hat, and how labels/outcomes are derived (e.g., gold passage labels / retrieval metrics). It also does not reflect baselines (mean aggregation/self-consistency) or the explicit Best-of-N oracle framing shown in Fig. 1."

              "score": 0.86,
              "reason": "The training vs. inference separation is clear, with arrows indicating: sample multiple candidates from an LLM, use retrieval-based assessment to rank candidates during training, fit a reward model, then at inference score candidates and pick the best. The inclusion of a concrete dialog snippet and example candidate reformulations helps convey intent. Some details remain ambiguous (what exactly is 'assessment' and how retrieval signals supervise the reward model; what S contains; what the final output is used for), but the high-level operating principle is understandable."

              "score": 0.34,
              "reason": "As a system overview, it does not aim to summarize the full paper end-to-end. It excludes the broader empirical study (five datasets, metrics, results), the motivation/analysis around test-time scaling vs SFT/self-consistency, ablation/robustness analyses, and any quantitative findings. It also omits implementation/training details (loss, model size, sampling strategy, N selection) and evaluation protocol. Thus it is not a complete summary of the paper, only the main method pipeline."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "The figure’s elements (LLM sampling N candidates, retrieval-based assessment for training, reward model training, and reward-model-based best-of-N selection at inference) align with the described AdaRewriter framework and Best-of-N paradigm. Minor potential over-specification appears in UI-like decorations/icons and the exact depiction of ranking storage/blocks, which are not explicitly described, but they do not introduce substantive new methodological components."

              "score": 0.92,
              "reason": "The pipeline correctly reflects: (i) given {q, H}, the LLM produces multiple candidate reformulations S1..SN; (ii) during training, candidates are evaluated via retrieval outcomes to produce supervision for a lightweight reward model (outcome-supervised, contrastive ranking implied by the ranking/assessment step); (iii) during inference, the reward model scores candidates to perform Best-of-N selection. This matches the paper’s stated training-time outcome supervision and test-time reward-guided selection. The figure abstracts away the exact loss formulation and how labels are derived, but the directional relationships are consistent."

              "reason": "Key labels—AdaRewriter, Reward Model, Candidate Reformulations, Retrieval, Ranking/Assessment, Training vs Inference, and Best-of-N Inference—are consistent with the terminology in the provided paper excerpt (Best-of-N, outcome-supervised reward model, black-box LLM). The only slight ambiguity is the generic 'Ranking Assessment' label, which is not a canonical named module in the text but is a reasonable label for the retrieval-based candidate evaluation used to construct training signals."

              "score": 0.78,
              "reason": "The figure communicates the high-level pipeline (training vs. inference, candidate generation, ranking/reward model, Best-of-N selection) with a clear left-to-right flow and visually separated sections. However, readability is reduced by (i) dense content and small text in the conversational example panel, (ii) duplicated/overlapping visual elements between the two styles of the same overview (top and bottom versions), and (iii) somewhat cluttered iconography/logos that competes with the core process boxes. Enlarging fonts, simplifying the example panel, and removing redundant decorative icons would improve scanability and reduce cognitive load."

              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "Overall flow is clear: left-to-right within each lane (Samples → LLM → Candidate Reformulations → Ranking/Reward Model → selection), and top-to-bottom separation between Training and Inference. Minor ambiguity arises because the left illustrative panel (chat bubbles + icons) competes with the main pipeline for the viewer’s starting point."

              "score": 0.95,
              "reason": "Connectors are mostly clean with essentially no line crossings; branches from the candidate stack to downstream modules are routed without overlap. Any perceived clutter is due to dense icons/labels rather than actual crossing edges."

              "score": 0.85,
              "reason": "Training-related components are grouped in the top lane and inference components in the bottom lane; candidate reformulations and reward model are placed logically close to their use. The separate left example panel is useful but slightly distant from the specific stages it exemplifies, which weakens immediate mapping between example and pipeline steps."

              "reason": "Major blocks (Samples, LLM, candidate stack, reward model) are aligned reasonably well within lanes. However, some internal elements (candidate boxes, vertical ellipsis, and output selections) have small alignment inconsistencies and varying spacing, especially between training vs inference sections."

              "score": 0.88,
              "reason": "The Training/Inference separation with colored backgrounds and the 'AdaRewriter' header create strong structure. The Reward Model is highlighted by a distinct color and iconography. Slight hierarchy dilution occurs because the left illustrative panel and numerous small icons can draw attention away from the core pipeline."

              "score": 0.75,
              "reason": "Outer margins are adequate, but within-lane spacing is somewhat tight: candidate stacks, arrows, and labels are dense, and the right-side selection outputs are packed. The left example panel is visually busy and close to the main figure, increasing perceived crowding."
            },
            {
              "question": "4.7. Consistency: Are components with similar roles represented with the same shape and color?",
              "score": 0.9,
              "reason": "Repeated elements (Samples, LLM, candidate reformulation stacks) use consistent shapes and labels across training and inference; the Reward Model is consistently colored and styled. Minor inconsistencies include mixed icon styles (LLM provider icons, small badges) and varied visual treatments for selection outputs, which slightly affects uniformity."

              "score": 0.58,
              "reason": "The figure uses recognizable icons (LLM/provider logos, database/retrieval cylinder, reward-model module, check/cross markers) and compact labels (S1…Sn) to concretize steps like sampling, ranking, and selection. However, most abstraction is still carried by text boxes and standard block-diagram arrows rather than richer symbolic/metaphoric encodings of the underlying ideas (e.g., “reward”, “adaptation”, “oracle”)."

              "score": 0.44,
              "reason": "The overall style aligns with a common NLP/ML systems schematic: modular pipeline blocks, arrows, and two-phase (training vs inference) separation with light color bands. The integration of chat screenshots alongside the pipeline adds some distinctiveness, but the visual language remains close to widely used paper-figure conventions."

              "question": "5.3. Adaptability: Does it apply a layout more suitable for the specific paper, breaking away from uniform design principles?",
              "score": 0.67,
              "reason": "The layout is tailored to AdaRewriter’s core contribution by juxtaposing training vs inference and explicitly showing where retrieval-based assessment exists only in training while reward-model scoring drives test-time Best-of-N selection. The left-side conversational example anchors the task context effectively, indicating adaptation beyond a purely generic flowchart, though the structure still largely follows standard left-to-right pipeline organization."
