Given a natural language query, LLM 1) generates steps to formulate it as an SMT problem, 2) generates corresponding codes that encode the problem and call the solver. If the solver is not able to find the solution, LLM receives unsatisfiable reasons from the solver, collects information, analyzes the current situation, and offers suggestions to modify the query interactively. LLM then updates the code based on suggestions and calls the solver again to find a feasible plan.",
