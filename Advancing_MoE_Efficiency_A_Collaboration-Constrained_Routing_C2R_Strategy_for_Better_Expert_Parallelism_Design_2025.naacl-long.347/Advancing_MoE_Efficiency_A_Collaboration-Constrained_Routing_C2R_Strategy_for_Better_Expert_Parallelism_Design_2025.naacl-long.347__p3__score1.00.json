(a) shows the process of expert profiling where we obtain the expert collaboration matrix for each layer of the MoE model; (b) describes the mechanism of our C2R strategy. It first selects the top-1 expert for a given token (Expert i here) and then selects the remaining K− 1 experts from list Top-T(Expert i); (c) shows our efficient expert parallelism design.",
