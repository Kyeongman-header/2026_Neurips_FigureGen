  "caption": "Table 3: Qualitative comparison of event extraction by GPT-4o-Mini and QA+NLI pipelines. In example 1, the LLM-based pipeline identifies a disease missed by QA+NLI. In Example 2, it filters out an irrelevant international event mistakenly extracted by QA+NLI. Example 3 shows the LLM capturing an illness caused by contaminated water, which QA+NLI misses. In the final example, it excludes the article lacking an infectious disease component, unlike QA+NLI. Overall, LLM’s inherent knowledge enables more accurate event extraction and contextual filtering of articles.",
