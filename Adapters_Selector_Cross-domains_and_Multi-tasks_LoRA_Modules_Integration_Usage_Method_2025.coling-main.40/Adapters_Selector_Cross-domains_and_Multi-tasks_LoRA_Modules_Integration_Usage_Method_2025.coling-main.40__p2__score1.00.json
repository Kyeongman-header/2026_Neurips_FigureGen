Firstly, every domain-specific task-specific dataset is used to fine-tune the model and obtain the adapters index. Secondly, each dataset should undergo data selection and the resulting subsets should then be randomly mixed with shuffling in order to train the selector. Finally, the adapter and selector are integrated into the base model for inference.",
